Not long after <a href=\"https://hothardware.com/tags/intel\">Intel</a> suffered the bulk of fallout from Meltdown and Spectre, the company bolstered its bug bounty program to encourage more people to dive in and discover bugs before they can be exploited.</p><p>Intel made great strides to improve the program overall by cutting out the invite-only requirement, allowing anyone to find, explore and report potential bugs. Clearly, <a href=\"https://hothardware.com/tags/microsoft\">Microsoft</a> liked that idea, as it has also enhanced its bug bounty program to offer the the same top quarter million dollar reward that Intel is coughing up.</p><p>There is a caveat, however; this particular set of bug bounty rules is exclusive to vulnerabilities that surround speculative execution bugs, which are at the heart of Meltdown and Spectre. Microsoft lays out explicit details about what kind of bug would qualify:</p><ul><li>A novel category or exploit method for a Speculative Execution Side Channel vulnerability.</li><li>A novel method of bypassing a mitigation imposed by a hypervisor, host or guest using a Speculative Execution Side Channel attack. For example, this could include a technique that can read sensitive memory from another guest.</li><li>A novel method of bypassing a mitigation imposed by Windows using a Speculative Execution Side Channel attack. For example, this could include a technique that can read sensitive memory from the kernel or another process.</li><li>A novel method of bypassing a mitigation imposed by the Microsoft Edge using a Speculative Execution Side Channel attack. For example, this could include a technique that can read sensitive memory from the Microsoft Edge content.</li></ul><p>In order to qualify for the big \"prize\" of $250,000, the submission must involve a bug that is in a novel category of speculative execution attack that neither Microsoft nor industry partners are aware of. Ideally, this is the payout Microsoft would pay most often, because those bugs would clearly be the most severe. Other levels include reading sensitive memory involving virtual machines and verification of certain bugs actually being exploitable with select Microsoft products, such as Windows 10 or the Edge web browser.</p><p>Overall,  this is a great move from Microsoft and i's somewhat reassuring as normal end-users to see this kind of commitment being made. </p></div></div>","score":92,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521327312,"text":"The offer is limit to bugs that are not already known to Microsoft or their partners, and they are not disclosing what these bugs are, and they are making no claim to have fixed them.

So, let’s get started.</p><h2 id=\"first-the-inspiration\">First, the Inspiration</h2><p>I first saw the video above, which goes into a lot of detail about how to actually break a wine glass with your voice. A few main points are covered, and Mike Boyd, the creator, quickly touches upon them. He recommends:</p><ul><li>Having a real crystal glass</li><li>Preferring a thinner, longer crystal glass</li><li>Striking the glass to get it to resonate</li><li>Using a spectrum analyzer to find the resonant frequency of the glass</li><li>Using a straw to visualize when the glass is resonating</li></ul><p>With that in order, it wasn’t until I tried breaking my third glass that I realized the last thing that ensures you really break a glass on command:</p><ul><li>Having micro abrasions in the glass. It can’t be perfectly new and clean.</li></ul><p>Without the micro abrasions (either caused by cleaning the glass with soap and water or a very light sanding), the glass wouldn’t break at all.</p><h2 id=\"an-aside-about-how-resonance-works\">An Aside About How Resonance Works</h2><p>When Mike Boyd breaks the glass in the above video, he’s using the acoustic resonance of the wine glass.</p><p>Crystal wine glasses have a natural frequency of vibration that you can hear when you strike them.</p><p>Any sounds at this frequency have the potential to make the wine glass absorb more energy than at any other frequency. Our hope is that our program and speakers will generate enough energy in the glass to break it.</p><h2 id=\"writing-a-prototype-sketch\">Writing a Prototype Sketch</h2><p>After seeing the video and being inspired to try recreating it, I needed to first get a prototype in place.</p><p>Would I be able to get a straw to resonate like in that example video?</p><p>Luckily, my <a href=\"https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/voice-controlled-flappy-bird/\">Voice Controlled Flappy Bird</a> post already does the difficult part of detecting the current pitch frequency from a microphone.</p><p>So, hypothetically, striking the wine glass should produce the proper tone to break the glass itself.</p><p>Using the pitch detection code, the only thing that would be left is to play out the pitch frequency detected by a microphone. The code is straightforward enough using Pygame, Music21, and

there are a few things to note here.</p><p>One, I use <code>rtmidi</code> utility to be able to dial in the resonant frequency using a Midi controller. This lets me adjust the knobs in order to find a place where the straw vibrates the most inside of my wine glass.</p><p>Secondly, we use <code>pyaudio</code> to generate our sine wave of the resonant frequency. We could have used another library with more immediate feedback, but this was easiest to get in place.</p><p>Now, the way the program works is that you strike the glass, and hopefully the <code>voiceController</code> library detects a resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of wine glasses should be between 600 - 900 Hz. Once you’ve got that, you press the SPACEBAR, and that starts playing that resonant frequency out the speakers.</p><p>With this, I was able to generate the results you see from my daily sketch on my desktop computer speakers.</p><p>However, I wasn’t able to break the glass. I had a hunch it was because I wasn’t able to generate the volume necessary.</p><h2 id=\"bringing-in-the-big-guns\">Bringing in the Big Guns</h2><p>Since I couldn’t get my glass to break with my desktop speakers, I started looking around the web to see how other people have broken glass with speakers.</p><p>The best resource I found was from the <a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/acoustics_info/glass/?content=glass3\">University of Salford</a>. They recommend using a 2” “compression driver in order to get results. So, I went off to Amazon, and picked up a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2pjyzVj\">2” compression driver</a>.</p><p>With this, the only thing remaining was to get an audio amplifier capable of driving the speaker to an (un)reasonable volume. I used <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2plJCNb\">this</a>, and I plan on using both the amplifier and driver in more audio projects in the future.</p><p>Finally, I needed to build a stand for the speaker, along with a cone to focus the energy of the wave. For this, I used Blender, along with my Prusa i3 MK2. I printed it in PLA, and it seemed to have done the job well enough.</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/images/break-glass/speaker.png\"/></figure><p>With the speaker cone 3D printed, I was finally ready to build my setup.</p><p>It looks something like this:</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/images/break-glass/diagram.png\"/></figure><p>It consists of a Snowball USB microphone, plugged into a laptop. The laptop runs the sketch from above, first waiting to detect a resonant frequency.</p><p>You strike the glass, and if the detected resonant frequency is in the zone you’d expect (again, 600Hz to around 900Hz), you press SPACEBAR to begin playing back that resonant frequency.</p><p>The audio output is hooked up to an amplifier, and that amplifier is hooked up to the driver with the 3D printed code. That cone is pointed directly at the top of the wine glass, as you saw in the gif in the introduction.</p><p>With that, the glass breaks!</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/images/break-glass/header.jpg\"/></figure><h2 id=\"where-to-go-from-here\">Where to Go From Here</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/burningion/break-glass-with-resonant-frequency\">code</a>, along with the 3D printable <a href=\"https://github.com/burningion/break-glass-with-resonant-frequency/blob/master/stl/speakerboxxx.stl\">cone STL</a> is at Github.</p><p>The program that finally breaks the glass used in the video is slightly different from what I’ve written above. It doesn’t adjust with the MIDI controller, because I found it wasn’t necessary in my case to adjust the detected frequency. The glass broken anyways.</p><p>If you plan on trying to recreate my experiment, <em>please wear safety glasses and ear protection</em>.</p><p>Ear damage is accumulative, and not wearing proper ear protection means damaging your ears permanently. So please don’t do that.</p><p>And the glass breaks all over the place, so please wear eye protection too.

In less than five minutes, Haycock has unscrewed and removed the blades, cleaned out some gunk from inside the machine, oiled the blades, and screwed it all back together. The clippers purr happily.</p><p> William looks sheepish; Haycock looks pleased. “I wish they were all that simple,” he says. </p><p>Today, the repairers will divert 24kg of waste from going to landfill and save 284kg of CO2.

And then you hear about things that happen [in the factories] in the far east.”</p><figure id=\"img-2\"><a href=\"#img-2\"><div><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=6b4c258fc14bc3066aab23fead9bdc0e 1240w\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=56ed6071cfd080cf1cb67bafb72e24a0 620w\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=605&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=aacbfe906d8c653ea1810718ef2e043e 1210w\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=605&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=002e456b6121f896565c8c0f6fe58aca 605w\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=445&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=5ecbe2e82d3ec38209b92027e4e568cf 890w\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=445&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b077dc6efc98c7d784c3ecd2a1ead890 445w\"><img alt=\"Sophie Unwin.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=1bf26f561cfaef82e51fda463b1338eb\"/></source></source></source></source></source></source></picture></div><span><svg><path></path></svg></span></a><div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2018%2Fmar%2F15%2Fcan-we-fix-it-the-repair-cafes-waging-war-on-throwaway-culture%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f%2F0_224_6720_4032%2F6720.jpg\"><span><svg><path></path></svg></span><span>Facebook</span></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Can%20we%20fix%20it%3F%20The%20repair%20cafes%20waging%20war%20on%20throwaway%20culture&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2018%2Fmar%2F15%2Fcan-we-fix-it-the-repair-cafes-waging-war-on-throwaway-culture%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2\"><span><svg><path></path></svg></span><span>Twitter</span></a><a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Can%20we%20fix%20it%3F%20The%20repair%20cafes%20waging%20war%20on%20throwaway%20culture&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2018%2Fmar%2F15%2Fcan-we-fix-it-the-repair-cafes-waging-war-on-throwaway-culture%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F852d27b668f87ee38017b34d6abc59c95225f52f%2F0_224_6720_4032%2F6720.jpg\"><span><svg><path></path></svg></span><span>Pinterest</span></a></div><figcaption><span><svg><path></path></svg></span> Sophie Unwin, the co-founder of the Remakery in Brixton and the founder of Edinburgh Remakery has been inundated with inquiries about setting up similar enterprises abroad.

This is partly driven by consumers’ eagerness for new products, but there are also concerns about built-in obsolescence, in which manufacturers design products to break down after a certain amount of time and are often difficult or expensive to fix. In December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/apple-admits-slowing-older-iphones-because-of-flagging-batteries\">Apple admitted to slowing older models of phones</a>, though it claimed it did this for operational not obsolescence reasons.</p><figure></figure><p> Repair cafe volunteer Stuart Ward says that when fixing items is actively discouraged by manufacturers, repair becomes a political act. He is vehement about the “right to repair”, a movement opposed to the practices of companies like the machinery company<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple\"> John Deere, which, under copyright laws, doesn’t allow people to fix their own equipment or take them to independent repairers.</a></p><p> “You own your equipment, you’re allowed to take a screwdriver to it and play with it,” he says. “It’s something fundamental.”</p><p>Teaching people how to fix their own gear is at the heart of the Edinburgh Remakery, a store on the main street of Leith that is part repair shop, part secondhand store, part repair education centre.<br/></p><p>“We do the repair in front of a customer, not out in the back, not hidden,” says Sotiris Katsimbas, the lead IT technician at the Remakery. To do this, Katsimbas and his team conduct one-to-one IT repair appointments for a small fee, as do their colleagues who specialise in sewing and furniture repairs.</p><p>“It’s a matter of confidence. It’s not magic. Someone put it together, someone can take it apart, you only need a Phillips screwdriver and some knowledge,” says Katsimbas as he shows Daniel Turner how to open up his laptop so he can clean out the fluff and dust that is causing the machine to overheat.</p><p>Since it opened in 2012, the Remakery has diverted 205 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in landfill. But the Remakery is unique in that, unlike much of the repair movement, which is volunteer-led, it is a viable business, employing 11 staff and 10 freelancers. Last year the shop had an income of £236,000 – 30% from grants, 70% generated through sales of furniture and electronics, workshops and repair appointments.</p><figure><details><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/140.jpg\" srcset=\" https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/140.jpg 140w , https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/500.jpg 500w , https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/1000.jpg 1000w , https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/2000.jpg 2000w , https://media.guim.co.uk/049cde3821e212153defc5ea6275d9fde38670f4/0_140_4700_2819/4700.jpg 4700w \"/><div><p><b>Fix it</b></p><p>If you want to learn how to fix your electronics, the Restart Project runs events to teach people, you can see where their events are <a href=\"https://therestartproject.org/\">here</a>.</p></div><div><p><b>Borrow it</b></p><p>If you want to fix something round the house, but don't have the tools you need and can't afford to buy them for a one-off job, you can find a local <a href=\"http://localtools.org/find/\">tool library</a> where you can hire what you need.</p></div><div><p><b>Read it</b></p><p>Michelle McGagh spent a year without buying new things, which involved a fair amount of fixing as well as going without, her experiences make for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/nov/26/no-spending-year-over-new-way-living-wealthier-wiser\">fascinating reading</a>.</p></div><div><span><svg><path></path></svg></span> Photograph: Nastco/iStockphoto</div></div></details></figure><p>The financial viability of the shop makes it attractive as a model.

Regular 5w30 will cost around $30 but it breaks down relatively quickly and needs to be changed if you&#x27;re lucky every 3k miles. Full synthetic on the other hand will set you back $100 plus and will last at least 7k miles.

We go over quaternionconvolutions, present a quaternion weight initialization scheme, and presentalgorithms for quaternion batch-normalization. These pieces are tested in aclassification model by end-to-end training on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and a segmentation model by end-to-end training on the KITTI RoadSegmentation data set. The quaternion networks show improved convergencecompared to real-valued and complex-valued networks, especially on thesegmentation task.</blockquote><div><table summary=\"Additional metadata\"><tbody><tr><td>Comments:</td><td>8 pages, 1 figure</td></tr><tr><td>Subjects:</td><td><span>Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)</span>; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)</td></tr><tr><td>Cite as:</td><td><a href=\"/abs/1712.04604\">arXiv:1712.04604</a> [cs.NE]</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>(or <span><a href=\"/abs/1712.04604v2\">arXiv:1712.04604v2</a> [cs.NE]</span> for this version)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h2>Submission history</h2>From: Chase Gaudet [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/show-email/a2a98758/1712.04604\">view email</a>]<br/><b><a href=\"/abs/1712.04604v1\">[v1]</a></b> Wed, 13 Dec 2017 04:19:24 GMT (117kb,D)<br/><b>[v2]</b> Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:08:56 GMT (117kb,D)<br/></div><div><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/auth/show-endorsers/1712.04604\">Which authors of this paper are endorsers?</a> | <a id=\"mathjax_toggle\" href=\"javascript:setMathjaxCookie()\">Disable MathJax</a> (<a href=\"/help/mathjax/\">What is MathJax?</a>)</div></div></div>","score":21,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521324645,"text":"There&#x27;s a lot of space to be explored at the intersection of ml and hypercomplex numbers.

For example, here are current results from MaxMind&#x27;s GeoIP service:<p><pre><code>  5.62.58.243 US\n  5.62.58.244 US\n  5.62.58.245 DE\n  5.62.58.246 DE\n  5.62.58.247 DE\n  5.62.58.248 US\n  5.62.58.249 US\n  5.62.58.250 US\n</code></pre>\nA couple weeks ago, BTW, 5.62.58.244 was identified as DE.

A few weeks ago I did GeoIP lookups on all 4 billion IPv4 addresses to find all the ranges of US IP addresses (there were 22029 ranges) as part of optimizing a filter that is supposed to reject non-US traffic from certain reports. To get an example for this comment I looked through those ranges looking for one where there were two different US ranges overlapping the same &#x2F;24, and 5.62.58.0&#x2F;24 was the first one I noticed.","parent":16607627,"id":16608346,"by":"tzs"},{"type":"comment","time":1521314380,"text":"It seems the ico is at odds with the EU here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitecase.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;alert&#x2F;court-confirms-ip-addresses-are-personal-data-some-cases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitecase.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;alert&#x2F;court-confirms-...</a><p>They also seem to be at odds with the GDPR:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;art-4-gdpr&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;art-4-gdpr&#x2F;</a>\n&quot;‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;&quot;<p>So yeah, a single IP in isolation might not trace back to a single individual - but with a timestamp and billing info it might track to a residence - with other data (eg: age, occupation) it certainly will trace back to an individual.<p>I&#x27;m surprised at the ico&#x27;s interpretation &#x2F; statement on this.<p>&gt; &gt; i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant as a tool for &quot;book burning&quot;<p>&gt; I think you&#x27;ve confused my statement of &quot;I suspect Hacker News would...&quot; to be a legal&#x2F;professional opinion about what Hacker News should do, or would be compelled to do so under the GDPR.<p>Indeed, that wasn&#x27;t mean as a direct reply to you, more as a general comment on the GDPR.<p>There&#x27;s a provision on right to be forgotten,  and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see that vis-a-vis a public interest in keeping an open archive of public discourse.<p>See 3a)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;art-17-gdpr&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;art-17-gdpr&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; The reason I think Hacker News would simply delete it has nothing to do with the GDPR, but because they seem to have responded to requests to delete an account and comments in the past:<p>True.

inspired by the drops of candle wax that formed on the tatami-mat floor at the home he shared with his wife, Suzu, in Osaka, according to his biography, Flowers of Wax.</p><p>After months of perfecting his technique, Iwasaki made Suzu a fake omelette, garnished with tomato sauce, that she initially failed to distinguish from the real thing.</p><p>While some artisans had already started making rudimentary food models in the 1920s, Iwasaki pioneered a production method that combined accuracy with volume, and opened a workshop in his hometown of Gujo Hachiman.</p><p>His <a href=\"http://www.ganso-sample.com/assets/images/corporate/history_02.jpg\">omelette</a> appeared at a department store in Osaka in 1932, and an industry was born.</p><p>The more prosaic theory is that the replica food boom grew out of demand by restaurants for models that re-created the increasingly eclectic range of Japanese and foreign dishes that appeared on menus in the postwar period.</p><p>“Eating out could be a challenge for some people in those days, so restaurateurs saw display models as a way of putting customers at ease,” says Katsuji Kaneyama, president of <a href=\"http://samplekobo.com/shop/\">Sanpuru Kobo</a> (Sample Kobo), one of several replica food firms in Gujo Hachiman, whose products account for about two-thirds of the domestic market.</p><h2>A balance between realism and aestheticism</h2><p>“The trick is in striking a balance between realism and aestheticism – the model that looks the most delicious isn’t necessarily the most realistic,” says Kaneyama, whose 10 full-time artists produce as many as 130,000 samples a year, made from durable PVC rather than wax. “And the most realistic models might not look all that tasty.”</p><p>In the shop attached to the Sample Kobo workshop, lines of tourists fill baskets with key rings, fridge magnets, USB flash drives, pencil sharpeners and other souvenirs, and try their hand at making fake tempura and lettuces.</p><figure id=\"img-1\"><a href=\"#img-1\"><div><picture><source

At the very least you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see those until you hit 300 level, but most likely not until graduate courses.<p>Discrete mathematics is a grab bag of topics, and it&#x27;s more fair to say that a discrete math course pulls in selected topics from other areas than to say it provides a focused coverage of any of them. At the depth each topic is taught, you couldn&#x27;t pull it out into its own semester&#x27;s worth of lectures. On the other hand, it would be very difficult to compact linear algebra into a discrete math course. Learning linear algebra already requires you to introduce a bunch of new concepts, like fields and vector spaces, linear equations, linear transformations, matrix representation and matrix operations, determinants, inner products...<p>Equally importantly, linear algebra doesn&#x27;t really &quot;fit&quot; with the topics of discrete mathematics, pedagogically speaking. It fits well with a treatment of multivariable calculus, but that&#x27;s only a small part of what&#x27;s taught in discrete math courses. If you wanted to teach linear algebra in a course covering a bunch of topics, you&#x27;d probably want to do a &quot;topics in abstract algebra&quot; course that works through groups, rings, modules, linear algebra and multilinear algebra. But then you&#x27;re going well beyond what a non-math major should encounter in an undergraduate setting.<p>Really, linear algebra stands on its own very well. In my opinion it should receive focused coverage and not be mixed with anything else. While graph theory and combinatorics can easily receive the same coverage, their treatment is usually pushed back to advanced undergraduate or graduate level courses because engineers don&#x27;t usually work with them beyond what&#x27;s covered in discrete math (which is exactly why we have discrete math as a standalone course). In fact, MIT actually lists linear algebra and multivariable calculus as <i>prerequisites</i> for the focused courses on combinatorics.

But I think you could self-study the material and be fine. The introduction of the book explains that it&#x27;s very focused on proofs, and it feels to me like it&#x27;s more of an applied mathematics book than it is discrete mathematics (i.e. computer science) book. That&#x27;s a subtle distinction, but I&#x27;d summarize it by saying this book feels as if it was written more for math majors than computer science majors. That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t read it; rigor and formalization are important! It just means that (as I interpret it), the authors are focusing more heavily on mathematical formalization and foundations than most &quot;discrete mathematics&quot; treatments.<p>For the context of my opinion: my favorite math textbook for computer science is Chapter 1, Section 1.2 of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> (&quot;Mathematical Preliminaries&quot;). That&#x27;s pretty dense though, so I usually recommend <i>Concrete Mathematics</i>, which was also (co)authored by Knuth. The benefit of <i>Concrete Mathematics</i> is that it spreads the information out with more examples and better exposition. It also includes an expanded section on probability. But in my opinion, the failing (if you could call it that) of both is that there isn&#x27;t a dedicated section on set theory. I really think that should be covered alongside the introduction to various types of proof.<p>Which brings me back to this textbook...I personally think it spends too much time building logic and proof machinery in the first chapter. Sets and functions have sections that are only pages long, but there is a large focus on logic. I understand it&#x27;s a mathematics for computer science treatment and not a pure mathematics treatment, but that&#x27;s actually pretty dry in my opinion - I think a treatment that focuses more on sets is more intuitive. One of the things I like about Knuth is that he covers these topics in a slightly irreverent and humorous way. He also engages the reader by jumping more directly into arithmetic operations, functions, basic number theory, the binomial theorem and combinatorics, etc.<p>Some of this is admittedly my own bias. I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> enjoyed staring at things like e.g. truth tables. It&#x27;s important to know, but this actually seems excessively formal for a discrete mathematics course. Reading through the algebra of propositions isn&#x27;t exactly riveting. I think that, for self-study at least, exposition and organization of topics is just as important (probably more so) than complete coverage of topics. All of the material you&#x27;d want to know <i>is there</i>, it&#x27;s just that the treatment might be a bit suboptimal for self-study. It probably depends on what you find interesting and how quickly you&#x27;d like to do interesting things with what you&#x27;re learning. It would probably also be beneficial if some people who have actually learned from this textbook for their first encounter with the material could chime in, because that might be more relevant to your question.","parent":16607645,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521308677,"text":"One discrete math book I liked was this one\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.wheaton.edu&#x2F;~tvandrun&#x2F;dmfp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.wheaton.edu&#x2F;~tvandrun&#x2F;dmfp&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s heavy on sets and functions, turning sets into types to manipulate in Standard ML so the reader can understand what&#x27;s going on intuitively.

The capabilities of modern provers, esp if combined with automated methods, can handle a lot more practical software than in the past. Even those like SPARK Ada with a lot of automation has properties that require manual proof. Certain things might also be easier to prove manually with a more powerful logic.<p>My hope is that I find enough feedback on good&#x2F;bad of cheap or free resources on this topic that I can determine some default recommendations for people curious. The problems can be addressed with supplementary material. Eventually, the defaults would be good enough that the process would happen faster. A larger number of people centering on the same resources might become a community for helping new people. That might increase the inflow. Simultaneously, some percentage of these people are working on tools, esp automated, to make the proof process more productive. Over time, we might have a much larger segment of people working on formal verification than we do now. Maybe even large enough to sustain more tool development by contributions or licensing.<p>So, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking at books like this with what I think they <i>might</i> help us achieve.

But is would be legitimately <i>hard</i> for most people to go through three pages of Rudin&#x27;s <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i> each day and consistently retain that information. Axler&#x27;s <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i> is very readable, but Halmos&#x27; <i>Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces</i> will start getting just as dense as Rudin. These are difficult textbooks even when students are well-prepared for them with prerequisite courses. Terence Tao wrote two books to cover (with better exposition) what Rudin did in one.

It is not a transcription, but something that I wrote from memory, mostly in a single stretch, while I had it still fresh in my mind. The result is that my 40 minutes talk became a text of more than 10,000 words, much longer than a typical internet document (but still less than Gibbon's six volumes on the same subject!) A talk, anyway, can be longer and more effective than a post, mostly because the people listening to you are not distracted by the infinite distractions of an internet connection.

I don't know if it will turn out to be more easily readable than the usual style but, if you arrive to the end, you'll tell me what you think of it. </i><1span><p><1span><1span> Ladies and gentlemen, first of all thank you for being here. This afternoon I'll try to say something about a subject that I am sure you are all interested in: the decline and the fall of the Roman Empire. It is something that has been discussed over and over; it is because we think that our civilization may follow the same destiny as the Roman one: decline and fall. So, the Roman Empire offers us some kind of a model. We can say it is the paradigm of collapsing societies. And, yet, we don't seem to be able to find an agreement on what caused the collapse of the Roman Empire. </p><p> Historians - and not just historians - have been debating this subject and they came up with literally dozens of explanations: barbarian invasions, epidemics, lead poisoning, moral decadence and what you have. Which is the right one? Or are all these explanations right? This is the point that I would like to discuss today. I'll be focusing on the interpretation of Joseph Tainter, based on the fact that empires and civilizations are \"complex\" systems and try to use system dynamics to describe collapse. </p><p> Before we go into this matter, however, let me add a disclaimer. I am not a historian and I don't pretend to be one. It is not my intention of criticizing or disparaging the work of historians. You see, there are several ways of making a fool of oneself: one which is very effective is to try teaching to people who know more than you. For some reasons, however, it happens all the time and not just with history; just look at the debate on climate change! So, what I am trying to do here is just to apply system dynamics on the history of the Roman Empire which - as far as I know - has not been done, so far. It is a qualitative version of system dynamics; making a complete model of the whole Roman Empire is beyond my means. But the results are very interesting; or so I believe. </p><h3> The collapse seen from inside. </h3> Let's start from the beginning and here the beginning is with the people who were contemporary to the collapse, the Romans themselves. Did they understand what was happening to them? This is a very important point: if a society, intended as its government, can understand that collapse is coming, can they do something to avoid it? It is relevant to our own situation, today. <p> Of course, the ancient Romans are long gone and they didn't leave us newspapers. Today we have huge amounts of documents but, from Roman times, we have very little. All what has survived from those times had to be slowly hand copied by a Medieval monk, and a lot has been lost. We have a lot of texts by Roman historians - none of them seemed to understand exactly what was going on. Historians of that time were more like chroniclers; they reported the facts they knew. Not that they didn't have their ideas on what they were describing, but they were not trying to make models, as we would say today. So, I think it may be interesting to give a look to documents written by people who were not historians; but who were living the collapse of the Roman Empire. What did they think of what was going on? </p><p> Let me start with Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who lived from 120 to 180 A.D. He was probably the last Emperor who ruled a strong empire. Yet, he spent most of his life fighting to keep the Empire together; fighting barbarians. Maybe you have seen the movie \"The Gladiator\": Marcus Aurelius appears in the first scenes. The movie is not historically accurate, of course, but it is true that Aurelius died in the field, while he was fighting invaders. He wasn't fighting for glory, he wasn't fighting to conquer new territories. He was just fighting to keep the Empire together, and he had a terribly hard time just doing that. Times had changed a lot from the times of Caesar and of Trajan. </p><p> Marcus Aurelius did what he could to keep the barbarians away but, a few decades after his death, the Empire had basically collapsed. That was what historians call \"the third century crisis\". It was really bad; a disaster. The empire managed to survive for a couple of centuries longer as a political entity, but it wasn't the same thing. It was not any longer the Empire of Marcus Aurelius; it was something that just tried to survive as best as it could, fighting barbarians, plagues, famines, warlords and all kinds of disasters falling on them one after the other. Eventually, the Empire disappeared also as a political entity. It did that with a whimper - at least in its Western part, in the 5th century a.d. The Eastern Empire lasted much longer, but it is another story. </p><p> Here is a piece of statuary from Roman times. We know what Marcus Aurelius looked like. </p><p> Now, if it is rare that we have the portrait of a man who lived so long ago, it is even rarer that we can also read his inner thoughts. But that we can do that with Marcus Aurelius. He was a \"philosopher-emperor\" who left us his \"Meditations\"; a book of philosophical thoughts. For instance, you can read such things as: </p><p><i>Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.</i></p><p> That is the typical tune of the book - you may find it fascinating or perhaps boring; it depends on you. Personally, I find it fascinating. The \"Meditations\" is a statement from a man who was seeing his world crumbling down around him and who strove nevertheless to maintain a personal balance; to keep a moral stance. Aurelius surely understood that something was wrong with the Empire: during all their history, the Romans had been almost always on the offensive. Now, they were always defending themselves. That wasn't right; of course. </p><p> But you never find in the Meditations a single line that lets you suspect that the Emperor thought that there was something to be done other than simply fighting to keep the barbarians out. You never read that the Emperor was considering, say, things like social reform, or maybe something to redress the disastrous situation of the economy. He had no concern, apparently, that the Empire could actually fall one day or another.</p><p> Now, I'd like to show you an excerpt from another document; written perhaps by late 4th century. Probably after the battle of Adrianopolis; that was one of last important battles fought (and lost) by the Roman Empire. This is a curious document. It is called, normally, \"Of matters of war\" because the title and the name of the author have been lost. But we have the bulk of the text and we can say that the author was probably somebody high up in the imperial bureaucracy. Someone very creative - clearly - you can see that from the illustrations of the book. Of course what we see now are not the original illustrations, but copies made during the Middle Ages. But the fact that the book had these illustration was probably what made it survive: people liked these colorful illustrations and had the book copied. So it wasn't lost. The author described all sorts of curious weaponry. One that you can see here is a warship powered by oxen.</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/liburna.png\"/></center> Of course, a ship like this one would never have worked. Think of how to feed the oxen. And think of how to manage the final results of feeding the oxen. Probably none of the curious weapons invented by our anonymous author would ever have worked. It all reminds me of Jeremy Rifkin and his hydrogen based economy. Rifkin understands what is the problem, but the solutions he proposes, well, are a little like the end result of feeding the oxen; but let me not go into that. The point is that our 4th century author does understand that the Roman Empire is in trouble. Actually, he seems to be scared to death because of what's happening. Read this sentence, I am showing it to you in the original Latin to give you a sense of the flavor of this text. <p><i>“In primis sciendum est quod imperium romanum circumlatrantium ubique nationum perstringat insania et omne latus limitum tecta naturalibus locis appetat dolosa barbaries.\"</i></p><p> Of course you may not be able to translate from Latin on the spot. For that, being Italian gives you a definite advantage. But let me just point out a word to you: <i>\"circumlatrantium\" </i>. which refers to barbarians who are, literally, \"barking around\" the empire's borders. They are like dogs barking and running around; and not just barking - they are trying hard to get in. It is almost a scene from a horror movie. A nightmare. So the author of \"Of matters of war\" is thinking of how to get rid of these monsters. But his solutions were not so good. Actually it was just wishful thinking. None of these strange weapons were ever built. Even our 4th century author, therefore, fails completely in understanding what were the real problems of the Empire. </p><p> Now, I would like to show you just another document from the time of the Roman Empire. It is \"De Reditu suo\", by Rutilius Namatianus. The title means \"of his return\". Namatianus was a patrician who lived in the early 5th century; he was a contemporary of St. Patrick, the Irish saint. He had some kind of job with the imperial administration in Rome. It was some decades before the \"official\" disappearance of the Western Roman Empire; that was in 476, when the last emperor, Romolus Augustulus, was deposed. You may have seen Romulus Augustulus as protagonist of the movie \"The Last Legion\". <img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/de_reditu.jpg\"/> Of course that is not a movie that pretends to be historically accurate, but it is fun to think that after so many years we are still interested in the last years of the Roman Empire - it is a subject of endless fascination. Even the book by Namatianus has been transformed into a movie, as you can see in the figure. It is a work of fantasy, but they have tried to be faithful to the spirit of Namatianus' report. It must be an interesting movie, but it has been shown only in theaters in Italy, and even there for a very short time; so I missed it. But let's move on.</p><p> Namatianus lived at a time that was very close to the last gasp of the Empire. He found that, at some point, it wasn't possible to live in Rome any longer. Everything was collapsing around him and he decided to take a boat and leave. He was born in Gallia, that we call \"France\" today, and apparently he had some properties there. So, that is where he headed for. That is the reason for the title \"of his return\". He must have arrived there and survived for some time, because the document that he wrote about his travel has survived and we can still read it, even though the end is missing. So, Namatianus gives us this chilling report. Just read this excerpt:</p><p><i>\"I have chosen the sea, since roads by land, if on the level, are flooded by rivers; if on higher ground, are beset with rocks. Since Tuscany and since the Aurelian highway, after suffering the outrages of Goths with fire or sword, can no longer control forest with homestead or river with bridge, it is better to entrust my sails to the wayward.\" </i></p><p> Can you believe that? If there was a thing that the Romans had always been proud of were their roads. These roads had a military purpose, of course, but everybody could use them. A Roman Empire without roads is not the Roman Empire, it is something else altogether. Think of Los Angeles without highways. <i>\"Sic transit gloria mundi\" </i>, as the Romans would say; there goes the glory of the world. Namatianus tells us also of silted harbors, deserted cities, a landscape of ruins that he sees as he moves north along the Italian coast. </p><p> But what does Namatianus think of all this? Well, he sees the collapse all around him, but he can't understand it. For him, the reasons of the fall of Rome are totally incomprehensible. He can only interpret what is going on as a temporary setback. Rome had hard times before but the Romans always rebounded and eventually triumphed over their enemies. It has always been like this, Rome will become powerful and rich again. </p><p> There would be much more to say on this matter, but I think it is enough to say that the Romans did not really understand what was happening to their Empire, except in terms of military setbacks that they always saw as temporary. They always seemed to think that these setbacks could be redressed by increasing the size of the army and building more fortifications. Also, it gives us an idea of what it is like living a collapse \"from the inside\". Most people just don't see it happening - it is like being a fish: you don't see the water. </p><p> The situation seems to be the same with us: talking about the collapse of our civilization is reserved to a small bunch of catastrophists; you know them; ASPO members, or members of The Oil Drum - that kind of people. Incidentally, we can't rule out that at some moment at the time of the Roman Empire there was something like a \"Roman ASPO\", maybe \"ASPE,\" the \"association for the study of peak empire\". If it ever existed, it left no trace. That may also happen with our ASPO; actually it is very likely, but let's go on.</p><h3> What destroyed the Roman Empire? </h3><p> From our perspective we can see the cycle of the Roman Empire as one that is nicely complete. We can see it from start to end; from the initial expansion to the final collapse. As I said, a lot of documents and data have been lost but, still, we have plenty of information on the Empire - much more than for other past empires and civilizations that collapsed and disappeared as well. Yet, we don't seem to be able to find an agreement on the reasons of the collapse. </p><p> You have surely read Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\"; at least parts of it. Gibbon wrote a truly monumental account of the story of the Empire, but he doesn't really propose us a \"theory\" of the causes of the fall, as most historians would do, later on. On reading Gibbon's work, you understand that he thinks there was a sort of loss of moral fiber in the Romans. He attributes this loss to the negative effect of Christianity. That is, the noble virtues of the Ancient Romans - he says - had been corrupted by this sect of fanatics coming from the East. This had made the Romans unable to resist to the invading barbarians. </p><p> You'll probably agree that this explanation by Gibbon is a bit limited; just as are limited other interpretations by authors who came later. Spengler and Tonybee are two examples, but if we were to discuss their work in detail it would take - well - weeks; not hours. So, let me jump forward to the historian who - I think - has given a new and original interpretation of the decline of Rome: Joseph Tainter with his \"The Collapse of Complex Societies\". His book was published for the first time in 1990. </p><p> It is a great book. I suggest to you to read it and ponder it. It is truly a mine of information about collapses. It doesn't deal just with the Roman Empire, but with many other civilizations. Tainter goes well beyond the simplistic interpretation of many earlier authors and identifies a key point in the question of collapse. Societies are complex entities; he understands that. And, hence, their collapse must be related to complexity. Here is an excerpt of Tainter's way of thinking. It is a transcription of a interview that Tainter gave in the film \"Blind Spot\" (2008) </p><p><i>In ancient societies that I studied, for example the Roman Empire, the great problem that they faced was when they would have to incur very high costs just to maintain the status quo. Invest very high amounts in solving problems that don't yield a net positive return, but instead simply allowed them to maintain what they already got. This decreases the net benefit of being a complex society. </i></p><p> Here is how Tainter describes his view in graphical form; in his book.</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/taintercomplexity.png\"/></center> So, you see that Tainter has one thing very clear: complexity gives a benefit, but it is also a cost. This cost is related to energy, as he makes clear in his book. And in emphasizing complexity, Tainter gives us a good definition of what we intend for collapse. Very often people have been discussing the collapse of ancient societies without specifying what they meant for \"collapse\". For a while, there has been a school of thought that maintained that the Roman Empire had never really \"collapsed\". It had simply transformed itself into something else. But if you take collapse defined as \"a rapid reduction of complexity\" then you have a good definition and that's surely what happened to the Roman Empire. <p> So, what was important with the collapse of the Roman Empire is not whether or not there was an emperor in Rome (or, as it was the case later, in Ravenna). We might well imagine that the line of the emperors could have continued well after Romulus Augustulus - the last emperor. And even after him there remained a legitimate Roman Emperor in Byzantium, in the Eastern Empire. You could very well say that the Empire didn't disappear as long as there were emperors in Byzantium, that is, until Costantinople fell, in the 15th cenntury. And since the Russian Czars saw themselves as Roman emperors (that is where \"Czar\" comes from, from \"Caesar\"), you could say that the Roman Empire didn't disappear until the last Czar was deposed, in 1917. But that is not the point. The point is that the Roman Empire had started undergoing a catastrophic loss of complexity already during the third century. So, that was the real collapse. What happened later on is another story. </p><p> After that Tainter has spoken of complexity, and of the energy cost of complexity, it is perhaps surprising for us that he doesn't consider resource depletion as a cause of collapse. Resource depletion, after all, is the main theme of Jared Diamond's book \"Collapse\". It is how he interprets the collapse of many societies. Tainter explicitly denies that in his book. He says that if such a thing as depletion appears, then society should react against it. After all, it is normal: society always reacts to all kinds of crisis, and why shouldn't it react to resource depletion? This point made by Tainter may appear surprising - actually unpalatable - to people who have made resource depletion the centerpiece of their thought. Peak oilers, for instance. </p><p> The disagreement between peak oilers (and Diamond) and Tainter may not be so strong as it appears. That we'll see as we go deeper into the details. But before we do that, let me say something general about these explanations that people give for collapse. It happens all the time that people discover something that they describe as if it was the only cause for collapse. That is, they sort of get enamored of a single cause for collapse. They say, \"I have the solution; it is this and nothing else.\" </p><p> Consider the story that Roman Empire collapsed because the Romans used to drink wine in lead goblets; and so they died of lead poisoning. That has some truth: there is evidence of lead poisoning in ancient Roman skeletons; there are descriptions of lead poisoning in ancient Roman texts. Surely it was a problem, probably even a serious one. But you can't see this story of lead poisoning in isolation; otherwise you neglect everything else: the Roman Empire was not just people drinking wine in lead goblets. Think of a historian of the future who describes the fall of the American Empire as the result of Americans eating hamburgers. That would have some truth and for sure the kind of food that most Americans eat today is - well - we know that it is doing a lot of damage to Americans in general. But you wouldn't say that hamburgers can be the cause of the fall of the American Empire. There is much more to that.</p><p> The same kind of reasoning holds for other \"causes\" that have been singled out for the fall of Rome. Think, for instance, of climatic change. Also here, there is evidence that the fall of the Roman Empire was accompanied by droughts. That may surely have been a problem for the Romans. But, again, we might fall in the same mistake of a future historian who might attribute the fall of the American Empire - say - to the hurricane Katrina. (I have nothing special against the American Empire, it is just that it is the current empire)</p><p> The point that Tainter makes, quite correctly, in his book is that it is hard to see the fall of such a complex thing as an empire as due to a single cause. A complex entity should fall in a complex manner, and I think it is correct. In Tainter's view, societies always face crisis and challenges of various kinds. The answer to these crisis and challenges is to build up structures - say, bureaucratic or military - in response. Each time a crisis is faced and solved, society finds itself with an extra layer of complexity. Now, Tainter says, as complexity increases, the benefit of this extra complexity starts going down - he calls it \"the marginal benefit of complexity\". That is because complexity has a cost - it costs energy to maintain complex systems. As you keep increasing complexity, this benefit become negative. The cost of complexity overtakes its benefit. At some moment, the burden of these complex structures is so great that the whole society crashes down - it is collapse. </p><p> I think that Tainter has understood a fundamental point, here. Societies adapt to changes. Indeed, one characteristic of complex systems is of adapting to changing external conditions. It is called \"homeostasis\" and I tend to see it as the defining characteristic of a complex system (as opposed to simply complicated). So, in general, when you deal with complex systems, you should not think in terms of \"cause and effect\" but, rather, in terms of \"forcing and feedback\". A forcing is something that comes from outside the system. A feedback is how the system reacts to a forcing, usually attaining some kind of homeostasis. Homeostasis, is a fundamental concept in system dynamics. Something acts on something else, but also that something else reacts. It is feedback. It may be positive (reinforcing) or negative (damping) and we speak of \"feedback loops\" which normally stabilize systems - within limits, of course. </p><p> Homeostasis has to be understood for what it is. It is not at all the same thing as \"equilibrium\" as it is defined in thermodynamics. For example, a human being is a complex system. When you are alive, you are in homeostasis. If you are in equilibrium, it means that you are dead. Homeostasis is a dynamical equilibrium of forces. </p><p> Also, homeostasis cannot contradict the principles of physics. It can only adapt to physical laws. Think of yourself swimming in the sea. Physics says that you should float, but you need to expend some energy to maintain a homeostatic condition in which your head stays above the water. Now, suppose that your feet get entangled with something heavy. Then, physics says that you should sink. Yet, you can expend more energy, swim harder, and still keep your head above the water - again it is homeostasis. But, if nothing changes, at some moment you'll run out of energy, you get tired and you can't keep homeostasis any more. At this point, physics takes over and you sink, and you drown. It is the typical behavior of complex systems. They can maintain homeostasis for a while, as long as they have resources to expend for this purpose. </p><p> Something similar occurs for human societies. When there is a forcing, say, an epidemics that kills a lot of people, societies react by generating more children. Look at the demographic statistics for our societies: there is a dip in numbers for the world wars, but it is rapidly compensated by more births afterward. Also in Roman times there were epidemics and the eruption of the Vesuvius that killed a lot of people. But those were small forcings that the Roman society could compensate. </p><p> Not all forcings can be compensated, but we know that the Romans were not destroyed by an asteroid that fell into the Mediterranean Sea. It might have happened, and in that case there would have been no feedback able to keep the empire together. We would have a single cause for the disappearance of the Roman Empire and everybody would agree on that. But that has not happened, of course. Perhaps, something like that has happened to the Cretan civilization; destroyed by a volcanic eruption - but that's another story. </p><p> So, in Tainter's view there is this feedback relationship between complexity and energy. At least the way I interpret it. Complexity feeds on energy and also strains the availability of energy. It is feedback. And not just energy; resources in general. So, I think that Tainter is right in refusing a simple explanation like \"resource depletion is the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire\". But, clearly, resources are an important part of his model. I think Tainter had in mind the Roman Empire when he developed this model, but it is of quite general validity. If this is the way things stand, his model is not in contrast with the models we have that see resource depletion as the main factor that causes collapse. But not the only cause. We must see collapse as something dynamic, and now I'll try to explain just that. </p><h3> Dynamic models of collapse </h3><p> Once we start reasoning in terms of complexity, we immediately see the relationship of Tainter's model with other models. I can cite John Greer's theory of \"catabolic collapse\" but we can go directly to the mother of all theories based on feedback: the study called \"The Limits to Growth\" that appeared for the first time in 1972. </p><p> As we know, \"The Limits to Growth\" was not about the fall of the Roman Empire. The authors tried to describe our contemporary world, but the model they used is very general and perhaps we can apply it also to the Roman Empire. So, first of all, we need to understand how the model works. Let me show you a simplified graphic representation of the model</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/myrtveitresources_1.gif\"/></center> This image was made by Magne Myrtveit a few years ago and I think it nicely summarizes the main elements of the world model used for the Limits to Growth studies. <p> There is this problem with dynamic models; they are often very complex and difficult to understand. They use a graphical formalism, but if you look at one of these models made - for instance - using the \"Stella\" or \"Vensim\" software, all what you see is a jumble of boxes and arrows. If you are not trained in this kind of things, you can't understand what the model is about. Personally, often I find that the equations are clearer than all those boxes and arrows. </p><p> So, we need something more graphical, easier to understand, especially if we have to show these things to politicians. And, as I said, I think that Myrtveit has struck the right balance here: this graphic is \"mind sized\" (I am using a term from Seymour Paypert, who invented the \"logo\" programming language). It is mind sized because I think that you can make sense of this diagram in a few minutes. There remains a problem with politicians. Their attention span is more of the order of thirty seconds or less. But that is another problem. </p><p> So, Myrtveit's image shows us the major elements of the world model - the model of The Limits to Growth\" - and their relationships. You see population, agriculture, natural resources, pollution and capital· Five main elements of the model; each one is rather intuitive to understand. What is important is the feedback relationship that exists among these elements. Perhaps the most important feedback loop is the one between capital and natural resources. Here is how the authors of \"The Limits to Growth\" have described this relationship:</p><p><i> The industrial capital stock grows to a level that requires an enormous input of resources. In the very process of that growth it depletes a large fraction of the resources available. As resource prices rise and mines are depleted, more and more capital must be used for obtaining resources, leaving less to be invested for future growth. Finally investment cannot keep up with depreciation, and the industrial base collapses, taking with it the service and agricultural systems, which have become dependent on industrial inputs. </i></p><p> Considering just two elements, instead of five, is not in contradiction with the more complex model. It makes sense especially when you are not considering a whole empire but something more limited, for instance the oil industry. Here are the results of this approach, this time with the equations written in clear. </p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/predatorprey.jpg\"/></center> You see that we obtain \"bell shaped\" curves. We do see bell shaped curves whenever a natural resource is exploited in a free market conditions. The \"Hubbert curve\" for oil production is just one case. There are many others. The curve is the result of a phenomenon called overexploitation or overshoot that leads to destroy even resources which are in principle renewable. The story of whaling in 19th centuries is typical and I wrote a paper on that - I am writing another one. It is a fascinating subject: whales are a renewable resource, of course, because they reproduce. But they were hunted so efficiently that, by end 19th century, it is estimated that in the Oceans there were only 50 females left of the species that was most hunted: the \"right whale.\" (\"right\" is because it was easy to kill, of course nobody had asked the opinion of whales on this name). <p> If you consider all five elements, things become more complex, but the general approach doesn't change that much. You can play a game with the scheme in Myrtveit's figure and you can relate it to what Tainter said about human societies. You remember that Tainter says that if a crisis emerges, society will try to cope with it. From the scheme, you can see what happens as time goes by and as people do things to avoid collapse. </p><p> So, suppose that pollution becomes a serious problem. Let's imagine that fumes from smokestacks are killing people; then society will allocate some capital to reduce fumes. Say, they would place filters on smokestacks. But filters need energy and natural resources to be built and that will place some further strain on natural resources. That will put strain on capital - so, fighting pollution may accelerate collapse, but not fighting it may cause collapse as well, although for different reasons - because pollution kills people and that makes it more difficult to generate capital and so on. You see how it works. </p><p> Let's make another example. Suppose that population grows to the point that there is not enough food for everybody. In response, society will use a fraction of its natural resources to produce fertilizers which will increase the yield of agriculture. That, however, will create a further increase in population that will put further strain on population and generate more pollution. That, in turn, will put new strain on capital and resources, and so on... Within limits, society can always adapt in this way - it is homeostasis, as I said. But only within limits. </p><p> You can play this kind of game in various ways. The five elements figure by Magne Myrtveit is a good tool to gain a feeling of how society reacts to external interventions and how it evolves with the gradual depletion of natural resources. If these resources are non renewable, as it is the case of our mineral resources, eventually, the amount of capital that can be created and maintained must go down - it is one of the possible causes of collapse. Probably the most common. But in order to see how it is going to happen, you need to run the model in a computer and see what you get. Here are typical results, from the 2004 edition of \"The Limits to Growth\".</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/stateoftheworldlimitsgrowth_0.jpg\"/></center> This is called the \"standard run\" or the \"base case\" scenario. It is a run of the model with the parameters most closely fitting the present situation. You see collapse occurring - it is when you see industrial and agricultural production crashing down. As you can see, the more complex model still produces bell shaped curves, although non symmetric ones. <p> Note that the model doesn't have a \"complexity\" parameter built in. However, it is clear that when the industrial and the agricultural system cease to function it is complexity going down (and population as well, of course). So, in a certain sense, the \"Limits to Growth\" model is compatible with Tainter's model - or so I tend to see things.</p><p> Of course, you don't have to take this scenario as a prophecy. It is just a mental tool designed to amplify your understanding of the system. You can change the parameters and the assumptions - collapse can be postponed, but the model is very robust. An important point is that these bell shaped curves are typical and are always the result, unless you use very specific assumptions in input, usually assuming human intervention to avoid collapse. </p><p> People are very good at optimizing exploitation. The problem is that they exaggerate and take out of the system more than what the system can replace. And that is the reason of the curve. First you go up because you are so good at exploiting the resource; then you go down because you have exploited it too much. In the middle, there has to be a peak -it is \"peak-resource\". In the case of crude oil, people speak of \"peak oil\". In the case of a whole civilization, we may speak of \"peak civilization\". And, as we said before, peak civilization also corresponds to \"peak complexity\", in the sense that Tainter described.</p><p> One last point, here. Collapse is not irreversible. Society goes in overshoot, then collapses, but the collapse gives time to the overexploited resource to reform, so growth can restart after a while. Homeostasis is like orbiting around an equilibrium point, without ever reaching it. It is a cycle that may keep going up and down, or may dampen out to reach an approximately stable state. That is, if the resource is renewable. If it is not, like oil or uranium, when it is used up, there is no more. In this case, there is no return from collapse. Also, from the viewpoint of a human being, even a reversible collapse that involves society as a whole tends to last much longer than a human lifetime. So, for what we are concerned, collapse is irreversible if we are caught by it and is something that we don't like, clearly. So we set up things like ASPO and TOD to see if we can convince politicians to do something to avoid collapse. Whether we'll succeed is another matter, but let's not go into that now.</p><h3> The dynamic fall of the Roman Empire </h3><p> Now we know that we should expect to see these bell curves in the behavior of a complex civilization or an empire. So, we can try to give a look to the Roman Empire in this perspective and see if it agrees with an interpretation based on system dynamics. So, first of all, let me propose a simplified model based on the same scheme that Magne Myrtveit proposed for our world as described in \"The Limits to Growth\".</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/romanempiremodel.png\"/></center> Please do not take it as anything more than a sketch, but it may be helpful for us to understand the mechanism that lead the Empire to collapse. <p> Now, let me try to explain how this scheme could work. We know that the Roman Empire was based mainly on two kinds of resources: military and agricultural. I put the image of a legionnaire for \"capital resources\" because legions can be seen as the capital of the Roman Empire; military capital. This capital, legions, would be built on a natural resource that was mainly gold. The legions didn't mine gold, they took it from the people who had mined it (or had stolen it from somebody else). </p><p> This feedback between military capital and gold is a point that is very well described by Tainter in his book. You can read how military adventures played a fundamental role in the growth of the empire, and earlier on of the Roman Republic. There was a clear case of positive feedback. The Empire would defeat a nearby kingdom, rob it of gold and take part of the population as slaves. Gold could be used to pay for more legions and go on conquering more lands. Positive feedback: the more legions you have, the more gold you can rob; the more gold you have, the more legions you can create. And so on... </p><p> One of the inventions of the Roman was their capability of transforming gold into legions and legions into gold - as I said it is a very clear case of feedback. Still today we use the word \"soldier\", which comes from Latin, and it means \"hired\" or \"salaried\". It was not only gold, legionnaires were also paid in silver, but the concept remains the same. Legions paid for the salaries of the legionnaires using the profit they made from looting the conquered lands. </p><p> But, as conquest proceeded, soon the Romans found themselves without easy lands to conquer. It was a problem of EROEI; energy return on energy invested. In this case, GROGI (gold return on gold invested). After the easy conquests of the 1st century b.c., Gallia for instance, then things became difficult. The energy yield of conquering new lands went down. On the North East, the Germans were too poor - and also warlike. Conquering them was not only difficult, but didn't generate a profit. In the East, the Parthians were rich, but militarily powerful. Then on the West there was the Atlantic Ocean, the North was too cold, the south too dry. Negative feedback, you see?</p><p> With the legions not bringing any more gold, gold disappeared from the Empire for various reasons. In part it was to buy luxury items that the Empire couldn't manufacture inside its borders, silk for instance. In part, it disappeared because barbarian chieftains were paid not to invade the Empire or to fight alongside with the Romans. There were other reasons, but anyway gold was a dwindling resource for the Roman Empire, a little like our \"black gold\", petroleum. During the good times, the legions would bring back from foreign conquests more gold than what was spent but, with time, the balance had become negative. </p><p> Of course, military conquest was not the only source of gold for Rome. As I said, we are describing a complex system, and complex systems have many facets. So, the Romans had gold mines in Africa and in Spain. And they also had silver mines in Spain. There are no mines in the scheme; we could add mines to it, that wouldn't be a problem. But the problem here is that we don't have enough data to understand exactly the role of mines in the economy of the Roman Empire. We know, for instance, that silver mining declined in Spain with the decline of the empire. Did mining decline cause the collapse of the empire? Personally, I think not. At least, the Romans had started their expansion much earlier than they had conquered Spain and these mines. At the time of the wars with Carthage, it was the Carthaginians who held Spain and, I imagine, the silver mines. But this silver didn't help them much, since they lost the war and were wiped out by the Romans. So, we should be wary of single explanations for complex events. We can only say that mines are subjected to the same kind of negative feedback that affects military conquests. After you exploit the easy ores (or lands to be conquered) you are left with difficult ores (or lands) that don't yield the same profit. It is negative feedback, again. </p><p> Then, there was agriculture. Surely it was an important economic activity of the Roman Empire, as you can read, again, in Tainter's book. Agriculture is also subjected to positive and negative feedbacks as you can see in the scheme. With good agriculture, the population increases. With more population, you can have more farmers. In the case of the Roman Empire, as population grows, you can have also more legions which will bring back home slaves which can be put to work in the fields. But agriculture has also a negative feedback, and that is erosion. </p><p> You can see erosion in the scheme listed as \"pollution\". It affects agriculture negatively. It reduces population and sets everything backwards: negative feedback, again. The more you try to force agriculture to support a large populations (including the legions) the more strain you put on the fertile soil. Fertile soil is a non renewable resource; it takes centuries to reform the fertile soil, after that it has been lost. So, erosion destroys agriculture, population falls, you have a smaller number of legions and, in the end, you are invaded by barbarians. This is another negative feedback loop that is related to the fall of the Roman Empire. </p><p> The question of agriculture during Roman times is rather complex ad the data we have are contradictory; at least in some respects. There is clear evidence of erosion and deforestation, especially during the expansion period of the early Roman Empire. Then, during and after the third century, we have famines and plagues. These two things are related, plagues are often the result of poor nutrition. At the same time, we have evidence that the Romans of the late empire were unable to exploit in full the land they had. It is reported that plenty of land was not cultivated - apparently for lack of manpower. We also know that forests were returning with the 4th century a.d. So, there are various elements of the dynamic scheme which connect with each other. Apparently, the emphasis on military power took away resources from agriculture and ingenerated still another negative feedback: not enough people (or slaves) to cultivate the land. But it may also be that some areas of land were not cultivated because erosion had ruined them. </p><p> So, I have proposed to you a scheme and I described how it could work. But does it work? We should now compare the scheme with real data; fit the data to a model. The problem is that we don't have enough data to fit - we probably never will. So, I didn't try fitting anything; but I think I can show you some sets of data that are an impressive indication that there is something true in this dynamical model. </p><p> First of all, if the decline and fall of the Roman Empire has been a case of overexploitation of resources, we should expect to see bell curves for industrial and agricultural production, for population, and for other parameters. As I said, the historical data are scant, but we have archaeological data. So, let me show a plot that summarizes several industrial and agricultural indicators, together with a graph that shows how the extension of the Empire varied in time. It is taken from <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/060808.pdf\"> In search of Roman economic growth, di W. Scheidel, 2007\" </a>The other graph is taken from Tainter's book.</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/romanempire.png\"/></center> Especially the upper graph is impressive. There has been a \"peak-empire\", at least in terms of production and agriculture, somewhere around mid 1st century. Afterward, there was a clear decline - it was not just a political change. It was also a real reduction in complexity as Tainter defines collapse. The Roman Empire really collapsed in mid 3rd century. It had a sort of \"Hubbert peak\" at that time. <p> The other parameter shown in the figure, the extension of the empire, also shows an approximately bell shaped curve. The Empire continued to exist as a political entity even after it had been reduced to an empty shell in economic terms. If we think that the extension of the empire is proportional to the \"capital\" accumulated, then this relationship makes sense if we think of the dynamic model that we saw before. Capital, as we saw, should peak after production. This is a bit stretched as an interpretation, I admit. But at least we see also here a bell shaped curve. </p><p> There is more. Do you remember the curves that are calculated in the dynamic model for the relation Capital/resources? You expect the production curve to peak before the capital curve. Now, I proposed that this relation capital/resources exists between the Roman Army and the gold that they looted. So, do we have data that show this relationship? Yes, we do, although only approximately. Let's first see the data for gold. We don't have data for the amount of gold circulating within the Empire, but Tainter shows us the data for the devaluation of the Roman silver coin, which we would expect to follow the same path. Here are the data (the figure is taken from <a href=\"http://www.sublimeoblivion.com/2009/04/09/notes-tainter/\"> this site </a>):</p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/romaninflation-450x440.gif\"/></center><p>Now, the amount of precious metal within a denarius is not a precise measurement of the total gold or silver in the Empire, but it is at least an indication that this amount was going down after the first century A.D. And, since the Romans had started poor, earlier on, there must have been a peak at some time, \"peak gold\", probably in the 1st century a.d. </p><p> About the size of the Roman Army, we have this figure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roman-military-size-plot.png\"> from Wikipedia </a>. As you see, the data are uncertain, but if we consider the Western Empire only, there was a peak around 3rd century a.d. </p><center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/romanarmy-450x346.png\"/></center><p>So, you see? Army and gold show the correct relationship that we expect to have between capital and resource. they both peak, but gold peaks before the army. The Romans kept increasing the size of their army even after the economic returns that they got from military activities went down, actually may have become negative. It is exactly the same behavior of whalers in 19th century who kept increasing the size of the whaling fleet even it was clear that there weren't enough whales to catch to justify that. I think this is an impressive result. At least, it convinced me. </p><p> There is more if we look at the Roman population curve, although for this we must rely on very uncertain data (see, e.g. the paper by <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/070706.pdf\"> Walter Schneidel </a>. I can't show you a graph, here, too uncertain are the data. But it seems that, in any case, there was a population peak in the Roman Empire around mid 2nd century. If this is the case, the Roman population peak arrives after the production peak - just as shown in the \"standard run\" calculations for the world3 model. </p><p> So, I think we have enough data, here, to prove the validity of the model - at least in qualitative terms. Maybe somebody should collect good data, archaeological and historical, and made a complete dynamic model of the Roman Empire. That would be very interesting, but it is beyond my possibilities for now. Anyway, even from these qualitative data we should be able to understand why the Empire was in trouble. One of the main causes of the trouble was that it had this big military apparatus, the legions, that needed to be paid and didn't bring in any profit. It was the start of an hemorrhage of gold that couldn't be reversed. In addition, the Empire bled itself even more by building an extensive system of fortifications - the <i> limes </i> that had to be maintained and manned, besides being expensive in themselves. </p><p> The story of the fortifications is a good example of what we had said; the attempt of a complex system to maintain homeostasis. The Romans must have understood that legions were too expensive if you had to keep so many of them to keep the borders safe. So, they built these walls. I imagine that the walls were built by slaves; and a slave surely cost less than a legionnaire. Slaves, however, were not good as fighters - I suppose that if you gave a sword to a slave he might think to run away or to use it against you. You know the story of Spartacus, the leader of a slave revolt in Roman times. I am sure that the Romans didn't want to risk that again. But with walls the Romans had found a way to replace legionnaires with slaves. You needed less legionnaires to defend a fortification than to defend an open field. That was a way to save money, to keep homeostasis. But it wasn't enough - obviously. The Romans still needed to pay for the legions and - as a disadvantage - the walls were a rigid system of defense that couldn't be changed. The Romans were forced to man the walls all along their extension and that must have been awfully expensive. The Empire had locked itself in a cage from which it would never be able to escape. Negative feedback kills. </p><p> Military expenses were not the only cause of the fall. With erosion gnawing at agricultural yields and mine productivity going down, we should not be surprised if the empire collapsed. It simply couldn't do otherwise. So, you see that the collapse of the Roman Empire was a complex phenomenon where different negative factors reinforced each other. It was a cascade of negative feedbacks, not a single one, that brought down the empire. And this shows how closely related to the Romans we are. Surely there are differences: our society is more of a mining society and less of a military based society. We don't use slaves but, rather, machines. We also have plenty of gadgets that the Romans didn't have. But, in the end, the interactions of the various elements of our economy are not that much different. What brought down the Romans, and eventually will bring us down, is the overexploitation of the resources. If the Romans could have found a way to use their resources, agriculture for instance, in ways that didn't destroy them, erosion in this case, their society could have lasted for a longer time. But they never found an equilibrium point - they went down always using a bit too much of what they had. </p><h3> Avoiding Collapse </h3> From our viewpoint, we see what was the history of the Roman Empire. But, from inside, as we saw, it wasn't clear at all. But let's assume that someone had it clear, already at the time of Marcus Aurelius. I said that there might have been something like an ASPE; \"association for the study of peak empire\". Or let's imagine that a wise man, a Druid from foggy Britannia, an ancestor of Merlin the wise, was smart enough to figure out what was going on. You don't really need computers to make dynamical models, or maybe this druid made one using wooden cogs and wheels, the whole thing powered by slaves. So, let's say that this druid understood that the troubles of the Empire are caused by a combination of negative feedbacks and that these feedbacks come from the cost of the army and of the bureaucracy, the overexploitation of the fertile soil, the fact that Rome had exhausted the \"easy\" targets for conquest. <p> Now, it is a tradition of Druids (and also of ASPO) of alerting kings and rulers of the dangers ahead. After all, Merlin did that for King Arthur and we may imagine that the druid we are thinking of felt that it was his duty to do that with Emperor Marcus Aurelius. So, he decides to go to Rome and speak to the Emperor. Suppose you were that druid; what would you say to the Emperor? </p><p> Good question, right? I have asked it to myself many times. We could think of many ways of answering it. For instance, if gold is running out from the Empire's coffers, why not suggest to the Emperor to mount a naval expedition to the Americas? It is what Columbus would do, more than a millennium afterwards and the result was the Spanish empire - it was also based on gold and it didn't last for long. Maybe the Romans could have done something like that. But they didn't have the right technology to cross the oceans and, at the time of Marcus Aurelius, they had run out of the resources to develop it. So, they had to remain in Europe and to come to terms with the limits of the area they occupied. The Empire had to return its economy within these limits. So, there is only one thing that you, as the wise Druid from Britannia, can tell the Emperor: you have to return within the limits that the Empire's economy can sustain. </p><p> So you walk to Rome - kind of a long walk from Eburacum, in Britannia; a place that today we call \"York\". You are preceded by your fame of wise man and so the Emperor receives you in his palace. You face him, and you tell him what you have found:</p><p> \"Emperor, the empire is doomed. If you don't do something now, it will collapse in a few decades\"</p><p> The Emperor is perplexed, but he is a patient man. He is a philosopher after all. So he won't have your head chopped off right away, as other emperors would, but he asks you, \"But why, wise druid, do you say that?\"</p><p> \"Emperor, \" you say, \"you are spending too much money for legions and fortifications. The gold accumulated in centuries of conquests is fast disappearing and you can't pay enough legionnaires to defend the borders. In addition, you are putting too much strain on agriculture: the fertile soil is being eroded and lost. Soon, there won't be enough food for the Romans. And, finally, you are oppressing people with too much bureaucracy, which is also too expensive.\"</p><p> Again, the Emperor considers having your head chopped off, but he doesn't order that. You have been very lucky in hitting on a philosopher-emperor. So he asks you, \"Wise druid, there may be some truth in what you say, but what should I do?\"</p><p> \"Emperor, first you need to plant trees. the land needs rest. In time, trees will reform the fertile soil.\"<br/>\"But, druid, if we plant trees, we won't have enough food for the people.\"<br/>\"Nobody will starve if the patricians renounce to some of their luxuries!\"<br/>\"Well, Druid, I see your point but it won't be easy.....\"<br/>\"And you must reduce the number of legions and abandon the walls!\" <br/>\"But, but.... Druid, if we do that, the barbarians will invade us.....\"<br/>\"It is better now than later. Now you can still keep enough troops to defend the cities. Later on, it will be impossible. It is sustainable defense.\"<br/>\"Sustainable?\"<br/>\"Yes, it means defense that you can afford. You need to turn the legions into city militias and...\"<br/>\"And...?\"<br/>\"You must spend less for the Imperial Bureaucracy. The Imperial taxes are too heavy! You must work together with the people, not oppress them! Plant trees, disband the army, work together!\"<br/></p><p>Now, Emperor Marcus Aurelius seriously considers whether it is appropriate to have your head chopped off, after all. Then, since he is a good man, he sends to you back to Eburacum under heavy military escort, with strict orders that you should never come to Rome again. </p><p> This is a little story about something that never happened but that closely mirrors what happened to the modern druids who were the authors of \"The Limits to Growth.\" They tried to tell to the world's rulers of their times something not unlike what our fictional druid tried to tell to Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The heads of the authors of \"The Limits to Growth\" weren't chopped off, but they were surely \"academically decapitated\" so to say. They were completely ignored. Not just ignored, ridiculed and vituperated. It is not easy to be a druid. </p><p> So, here we found another similarity between our times and the Roman ones. We are subjected to the \"fish in the water\" curse. We don't understand that we are surrounded by water. And we don't want to be told that water exists. </p><p> As things stands, we seem to be blithely following the same path that the Roman Empire followed. Our leaders are unable to understand complex systems and continue to implement solutions that worsen the problem. As the wise druid was trying to tell to Marcus Aurelius, building walls to keep the barbarians out was a loss of resources that was worse than useless. But I can see the politicians of the time running on a platform that said, \"Keep the barbarians out! More walls to defend the empire\". It is the same for us. Tell a politician that we are in trouble with crude oil and he/she will immediately say \"drill deeper!\" or \"drill, baby, drill!\" Negative feedback kills. </p><p> But I would like to point out to you something: let's go back to what our fictional druid was telling to Emperor Aurelius. He had this slogan \"Plant trees, disband the army and work together\". I had invented it in a post that I had written on the collapse of Tuscan society in 16th century; it is another story but one that shows how all societies follow similar paths. Anyway, can you see what kind of world the Druid was proposing to the Emperor? Think about that for a moment: a world of walled cities defended by city militias, no central authority or a weak one, an economy based on agriculture. </p><p> Do you see it.....? Sure, <i> it is Middle Ages!</i> Think about that for a moment and you'll see that you could define Middle Ages as a solution for the problems of the Roman Empire! </p><p> So, our Druid had seen the future and was describing it to Emperor Aurelius. He had seen the solution of the problems of Empire: Middle Ages. It was where the Empire was going and where it could not avoid going. What the Druid was proposing was to go there in a controlled way. Ease the transition, don't fight it! If you know where you are going, you can travel in style and comfort. If you don't, well, it will be a rough ride. </p><p> We may imagine a hypothetical \"driven transition\" in which the government of the Roman Empire at the time of Marcus Aurelius would have done exactly that: abandon the walls, reduce the number of legion and transform them into city militias, reduce bureaucracy and Imperial expenses, delocalize authority, reduce the strain on agriculture: reforest the land. The transition would not have been traumatic and would have involved a lower loss of complexity: books, skills, works of art and much more could have been saved and passed to future generations. </p><p> All that is, of course, pure fantasy. Even for a Roman Emperor, disbanding the legions couldn't be easy. After all, the name \"Emperor\" comes from the Latin word \"imperator\" that simply means \"commander\". The Roman Emperor was a military commander and the way to be Emperor was to please the legions that the Emperor commanded. A Roman Emperor who threatened to disband the legions wouldn't have been very popular and, most likely, he was to be a short lived Emperor. So, Emperors couldn't have done much even if they had understood system dynamics. In practice, they spent most of their time trying to reinforce the army by having as many legions as they could. Emperors, and the whole Roman world, fought as hard as they could to keep the <i> status quo ante </i>, to keep things as they had always been. After the 3rd century crisis, Emperor Diocletian resurrected the Empire transforming it into something that reminds us of the Soviet Union at the time of Breznev. An oppressive dictatorship that included a suffocating bureaucracy, heavy taxes for the citizens, and a heavy military apparatus. It was such a burden for the Empire that it destroyed it utterly in little more than a century. </p><p> Our Druids may be better than those of the times of the Roman Empire, at least they have digital computers. But our leaders are no better apt at understanding complex system than the military commanders who ruled the Roman Empire. Even our leaders were better, they would face the same problems: there are no structures that can gently lead society to where it is going. We have only structures that are there to keep society where it is - no matter how difficult and uncomfortable it is to be there. It is exactly what Tainter says: we react to problems by building structure that are more and more complex and that, in the end, produce a negative return. That's why societies collapse.</p><p> So, all our efforts are to keep the <i> status quo ante </i>. For this reason we are so desperately looking for something that can replace crude oil and leave everything else the same. It has to be something that is liquid, that burns and, if possible, even smells bad. Drill more, drill deeper, boil tar sands, make biofuels even if people will starve. We do everything we can to keep things as they are. </p><p> And, yet, we are going where the laws of physics are taking us. A world with less crude oil, or with no crude oil at all, cannot be the same world we are used to, but it doesn't need to be the Middle Ages again. If we manage to deploy new sources of energy, renewable or nuclear - fast enough to replace crude oil and the other fossil fuels, we can imagine that the transition would not involve a big loss of complexity, perhaps none at all. More likely, a reduced flux of energy and natural resources in the economic system will entail the kind of collapse described in the simulations of \"The Limits to Growth.\" We can't avoid to go where the laws of physics are taking us. </p><h3> Conclusion: showdown at Teutoburg </h3> Two thousand years ago, three Roman legions were annihilated in the woods of Teutoburg by a coalition of tribes of the region that the Romans called \"Germania\". Today, after so many years, the woods of the region are quiet and peaceful places, as you can see in this picture <center><img src=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/files/teutoburg.jpg\"/></center><p>It is hard for us to imagine what the three days of folly of the battle of Teutoburg must have been. The legions surprised by the ambush of the Germans, their desperate attempt to retreat: under heavy rain and strong winds in the woods, they never were able to form a line and fight as they were trained to. One by one, almost all of them were killed; their general, Varus, committed suicide. The Germans left the bodies rotting in the woods as a sort of sacred memory to the battle. The ultimate disgrace for the legions was the loss of their sacred standards. It was such a disaster that it led to the legend that Emperor Augustus would wander at night in his palace screaming \"Varus, give me back my legions!\" </p><p> I think we could pause for a moment and remember these men, Germans and Romans, who fought so hard and died. We have seen so many similarity between our world and the Roman one that we may feel something that these men felt as well. Why did they fight, why did they die? I think that many of them fought because they were paid to fight. Others because their commander or their chieftain told them so. But, I am sure, a good number of them had some idea that they were fighting for (or against) the abstract concept that was the Roman Empire. Some of them must have felt that they stood for defending civilization against barbarians, others for defending their land against evil invaders. </p><p> Two millennia after the battle of Teutoburg, we can see how useless it was that confrontation in the woods soaked with rain. A few years later, the Roman general Germanicus, nephew of Emperor Tiberius, went back to Teutoburg with no less than eight legions. He defeated the Germans, recovered the standards of the defeated legions, and buried the bodies of the Roman dead. Arminius, the German leader who had defeated Varus, suffered a great loss of prestige and, eventually, he was killed by his own people. But all that changed nothing. The Roman Empire had exhausted its resources and couldn't expand any more. Germanicus couldn't conquer Germany any more than Varus could bring back his legions from the realm of the dead. </p><p> Civilizations and empires, in the end, are just ripples in the ocean of time. They come and go, leaving little except carved stones proclaiming their eternal greatness. But, from the human viewpoint, Empires are vast and long standing and, for some of us, worth fighting for or against. But those who fought in Teutoburg couldn't change the course of history, nor can we. All that we can say - today as at the time of the battle of Teutoburg - is that we are going towards a future world that we can only dimly perceive. If we could see clearly where we are going, maybe we wouldn't like to go there; but we are going anyway. In the end, perhaps it was Emperor Marcus Aurelius who had seen the future most clearly: </p><p><i> Nature which governs the whole will soon change all things which thou seest, and out of their substance will make other things, and again other things from the substance of them, in order that the world may be ever new. </i></p><p><i></i> Marcus Aurelius Verus - \"Meditations\" ca. 167 A.D.</p></div></div>","score":26,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521326848,"text":"Great quote made back in 2009 &quot;I can see the politicians of the time running on a platform that said, &quot;Keep the barbarians out!

He doesn&#x27;t focus in on complexity, he contradicts it - pinpointing Constantine&#x27;s crude-but-effective solution to constant rebellions and civil wars as the cause of the slow collapse: namely stationing perhaps two-thirds of Rome&#x27;s military permanently in the cities with independent commands (the &quot;palantines&quot;.) This prevented the regular barbarian-fighting armies (the &quot;Borderers&quot;) and their commanders from rebelling successfully because they were now a relatively small military minority that would have to fight city after city - even in their own area - just to usurp power locally. But, with one hand tied behind its back, Rome&#x27;s fall was inevitable from that point on. This &quot;prepared the ruin of the Empire&quot; in Gibbon&#x27;s words.

We signal a 'recursion' by simply raising an exception with the arguments we'd like to recurse with. Then our decorator simply unpacks the variables from the exception and tries calling the function again.</p><p>Eventually we'll reach our exit condition (we hope) and the function will <strong>return</strong> instead of raising an exception. At this point the decorator just passes along that return value to whoever was asking for it.</p><p>This particular method helps out with doing recursive calls in python because python has a rather small limit to how many recursive calls can be made (typically ~1000). The reason for this limit is (among other things) doing recursive calls takes a lot of memory and resources because each frame in the call stack must be persisted until the call is complete. Our decorator gets around that problem by continually entering and exiting a single call, so technically our function isn't actually recursive anymore and we avoid the limits.</p><p>I tested out both versions, the normal version hits the tail-recursion limit at factorial(980) whereas the tail-recursive version will happily compute numbers as large as your computer can handle.</p><p>There's an <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/recipes/474088-tail-call-optimization-decorator/\">alternative approach</a> that actually uses stack introspection to do it, but it's a bit more complex than the one we built here.</p><p>Hope you learned something, cheers!</p><p><div><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislpenner\">Follow @chrislpenner</a></div></p></div></div>","score":153,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521288808,"text":"Someone recently pointed out to me you can bypass the recursion limit with an inbuilt decorator, because it&#x27;s basically a memoiser.<p>lru_cache, from the functools library.<p>The example given in the docs [0] is:<p><pre><code>    import functools\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def fib(n):\n        if n &lt; 2:\n            return n\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;functools.html#functools.lru_cache\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;functools.html#functools.l...</a>","parent":16606191,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521293406,"text":"This only works in specific cases (namely those where dynamic programming algorithms suffice), and does not avoid the recursion limit in general.","parent":16606625,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521298633,"text":"Don&#x27;t dismiss one of my favorite higher order functions so soon :)<p>&quot;Recursion + memoization provides most of the benefits of dynamic programming, including usually the same running time.&quot; -- Steven Skiena<p>lru_cache decorator is great for people who are happy to let the language handle the caching of results for them, and often leads to code which is much more concise than the dynamic programming approach.

That was in 1985, and Potts is now leading his fourth decade of excavation. It’s a good thing he stayed. In recent years, his team has uncovered <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aao2646\">a series of unexpected finds</a>, which suggest that human behavior and culture became incredibly sophisticated well before anyone suspected—almost at the very dawn of our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p><p>The team found obsidian tools that came from sources dozens of miles away—a sign of long-distance trade networks. They found lumps of black and red rock that had been processed to create pigments—a sign of symbolic thought and representation. They found carefully crafted stone tools that are indicative of the period known as the Middle Stone Age; that period was thought to have started around 280,000 years ago, but the Olorgesailie tools are between 305,000 and 320,000 years old.</p></section><section id=\"article-section-2\"><p>Collectively, these finds speak to one of the most important questions in human evolution: When did anatomically modern people, with big brains and bipedal stances, become <em>behaviorally</em> modern, with symbolic art, advanced tools, and a culture that built on itself? Scientists used to believe that the latter milestone arrived well after the former, when our species migrated into Europe between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, and went through a “creative explosion” that produced the evocative cave art of Lascaux and Chauvet. But this conspicuously Eurocentric idea has been overturned by a wealth of evidence showing a much earlier origin for modern human behavior—in Africa, the continent of our birth.</p><p>The new discoveries at Olorgesailie push things back even further. They suggest that many of our most important qualities—long-term planning, long-distance exploration, large social networks, symbolic representation, and innovative technology—were already in place 20,000 to 40,000 years earlier than believed. That coincides with the age of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/\">the earliest known human fossils</a>, recently found elsewhere in Africa. “What we’re seeing in Olorgesailie is right at the root of <em>Homo sapiens</em>,” Potts says. “It seems that this package of cognitive and social behaviors were there from the outset.”</p><p>“They demonstrate human ways of thinking and doing that cannot be traced easily in the remains of our skeletons or genes,” says <a href=\"https://www.uj.ac.za/faculties/humanities/department-of-anthropology-and-development-studies/Pages/staff/Marlize-Lombard.aspx\">Marlize Lombard</a>, an archeologist at the University of Johannesburg. “They provide strong indicators that by about 300,000 years ago we were well on our way to become modern humans in Africa.”</p></section><section id=\"article-section-3\"><p>It’s a “textbook example of good archaeological practice,” adds <a href=\"https://www.wits.ac.za/gaes/staff/academic-staff/lyn-wadley/\">Lyn Wadley</a> from the University of Witwatersrand.</p><p>For the longest time, most of the tools that were uncovered at Olorgesailie were Acheulean handaxes—large, teardrop-shaped tools made by chipping away at cores of stone. Hominids like <em>Homo erectus </em>used these implements to butcher meat and cut wood. At Olorgesailie, they started doing this 1.2 million years ago, and continued until at least 500,000 years ago. And during all that time, the basic design of the axes changed very little. In an age where the phones in our pockets can become obsolete in a year, “the idea of a single technology lasting that long is almost inconceivable,” says Potts.</p><p>Acheulean hand axes did eventually go obsolete, giving way to the tools of the Middle Stone Age. These were smaller, more carefully shaped, more specialized, and more varied. Instead of just bulky axes and cleavers, they also included spear tips, scrapers, and awls. Potts’ team started finding these at Olorgesailie in the early 2000s, and <a href=\"http://www.bgc.org/people/each_person/deino_a.html\">Alan Deino</a> from the Berkeley Geochronology Center <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aao2216\">worked out how old they are</a> by analyzing levels of radioactive isotopes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon%E2%80%93argon_dating\">argon</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93thorium_dating\">uranium </a>in the samples. He concluded that these tools had completely replaced the Acheulean designs by at least 305,000 years ago.</p><p>Many of the tools were made from a black volcanic rock called obsidian, which was brought to the site and processed there. But from where? There aren’t any obsidian outcrops near Olorgesailie. The chemistry of the tools suggests that they came from sources up to 100 kilometers away. But “these are straight-line distances that, in some cases, go over the top of a mountain,” says <a href=\"https://anthropology.columbian.gwu.edu/alison-s-brooks\">Alison Brooks</a> from George Washington University.</p></section><section id=\"article-section-4\"><p>It’s unlikely that the residents of Olorgesailie regularly commuted to get their obsidian. Instead, they probably took part in long-distance trade networks, receiving obsidian from people who lived in distant locales presumably in exchange for other goods. “There’s an occasional piece in the Acheulean that gets transported these distances,” says Brooks. “But we have thousands of pieces in this one site that’s smaller than most people’s kitchens. There has been a really major import of raw materials.” If she’s right, then Olorgesailie’s obsidian network precedes other examples of long-distance trade by 80,000 to 100,000 years.</p><p>These networks help to explain another Olorgesailie discovery: colored rocks. One site contains 86 rounded lumps of manganese ore, which would have produced dark brown or black pigments. Another harbored two lumps of iron minerals that had clearly been deliberately ground with some sharp, chiseling tool to extract the red powder within. “Mixed with any kind of fat, or even rubbed on oily skin, it would have made a very wonderful paint,” says Brooks. “Pigments are often seen as the root of complex symbolic behavior,” says Potts. “Think of the way we use color on clothes, flags, and tattoos—all signals of social identity.”</p><p>As evidence for symbolic behavior, Brooks would give this a six on a scale of one to 10, where 10 would be something unambiguous like ochre-covered beads or cave art. Still, she notes that the colored rocks, like the obsidian, came from distant sources, which says something about their value. “Why go through all the trouble of importing pigment?” she says. “If you’re thinking about a way to signal at a distance that you’re not an enemy, having something red on your person is a good way to do it.”</p></section><section id=\"article-section-5\"><p>“These findings mark a step forward in our understanding of the origin of complex cultures,” says Daniela Rosso from the University of Bordeaux. She notes that archeologists have found evidence of pigment use in sites from France, Kenya, and the Netherlands, all of which have been dated between 250,000 and 300,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie specimens, once again, are even older, and the earliest known examples of clearly worked pigments.</p><p>In fact, some of the innovations that the team discovered were evident even earlier. Between 500,000 and 615,000 years ago, Acheulean technology still dominated at Olorgesailie. But there are occasional signs of smaller tools, more sophisticated designs, and materials being imported from long distances. “In the late Acheulean, we see the precursors of what became crystallized in the Middle Stone Age,” says Potts. It’s almost as if humanity already had the capacity for our later leap, but were missing some kind of trigger—something that precipitated a break with hundreds of thousands of years of cultural stagnation. But what?</p><p>The animal bones at Olorgesailie provide a clue. When people were still making Acheulean hand-axes, the landscape was dominated by large grazing mammals like elephants and giant baboons. But by the time the Middle Stone Age tools appear, 85 percent of these species have disappeared, and are replaced by smaller ones like springbok. “This shows that there’s something bigger going on than just changes in the hominins,” says Potts. “The hominins are responding to something, as are the rest of the mammals.”</p></section><section id=\"article-section-6\"><p>By analyzing the sediments at the site, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aao2200\">Potts found that its cultural shifts</a> took place at a time of—quite literally—great upheaval. Around 500,000 years ago, the relatively stable lake basin at Olorgesailie turned into an etch-a-sketch landscape that was continuously remodeled by earthquakes. By 360,000 years ago, the climate had become incredibly unstable, with big swings between dry and wet seasons, and large changes in the layout of rivers, lakes, and floodplains.</p><p>Perhaps it’s no coincidence that this was the world in which modern human adaptability arose—one of unpredictable weather and unreliable resources. Brooks has shown that modern hunter-gatherers also build larger networks in times of environmental turmoil. “It spreads the risk over a much wider landscape,” she says. “There’s no other way they can save for a future disaster. They don’t have crops or animals. They have friends. It’s part of a human way of life.”</p><p>“In view of this, the movement of stone and pigments could indicate increased interaction with immediately surrounding groups,” says <a href=\"http://anthro.utah.edu/faculty/pweissner/\">Polly Weissner</a>, an anthropologist at the University of Utah. And perhaps these broader networks ignited the development of new technology, allowing the culture to ratchet up from the longstanding Acheulean tradition into something more advanced.</p><p>“Could these sorts of behaviors been the leading edge of the origin of our species?” asks Potts. The old view says that <em>Homo sapiens</em> evolved complex cultures a long time after becoming a distinct species. But given the antiquity of the Olorgesailie finds, Potts now wonders if the emergence of complex behavior was “really the thing that distinguished the earliest members of our gene pool from other hominins?” Brooks agrees. “There was the argument that <em>Homo sapiens</em> came along and then developed all these things,” she says. “But now it seems that the behavior and the morphology came along together. Maybe the behavior even came first.”</p><p>“To my knowledge, the Olorgesailie studies document the context at the dawn of our species in much greater detail than any other early Middle Stone Age occurrence on the continent,” says <a href=\"http://www.wordsandbones.uni-tuebingen.de/?staff=yonatan-sahle\">Yonatan Sahle</a> from Tubingen University. But he cautions that the emergence of the Middle Stone Age “was neither straightforward nor uniform across space and time.” In different parts of Africa, it varies in when it first appears, how much it overlaps with the older Acheulean tech, and whether it occurs together with <em>Homo sapiens </em>fossils.</p><aside><hr/><h4> Related Story </h4><div><a href=\"/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/06/Jebel_Irhoud/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1496844805\" alt=\"\"/></a></div><p><a href=\"/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/\">Scientists Have Found the Oldest Known Human Fossils</a></p><hr/></aside><p>Indeed, “there’s a tendency for archeologists to say that every important thing happened at my site,” says Potts, “and I don’t want to mislead and say that the Middle Stone Age originated in Olorgesailie.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”</p><p>Documents seen by the <em>Observer</em>, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.</p><p>The <em>New York Times</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">is reporting</a> that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.</p><p>The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of<strong></strong>users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.</p><p>However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/16/trump-mueller-russia-indictment-what-does-it-mean\">indictments of 13 Russians</a> by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.</p><p>“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”</p><p>On Friday, four days after the <em>Observer</em> sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/\">Facebook announced</a> that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data.

The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.</p><p>The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.</p><p>Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.</p><p>Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”</p><p>Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”</p><p>Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the <em>Observer</em> which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.</p><p>At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.</p><p>The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.</p><figure></figure><p>That legal letter was sent several months after the <em>Guardian</em> first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.</p><p>“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.</p><p>Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.</p><p>“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”</p><p>Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.</p><p>“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”</p><aside><span><svg><path></path></svg></span><blockquote><p>We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons</p></blockquote></aside><p>A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.</p><p>Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.</p><p>Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.</p><p>Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.</p><p>The <em>Observer</em> has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.</p><figure></figure><p>The algorithm and database together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy\">made a powerful political tool</a>. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.</p><p>“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.</p><p>At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”</p><p>Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.</p><p>GSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.</p><p>SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Steve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.</p><figure><details><div><div><p><b>Alexander Nix, CEO</b></p><p>An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. </p></div><div><p><b>Aleksandr Kogan, data miner</b></p><p>Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan.</p></div><div><p><b>Steve Bannon, former board member</b></p><p>A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon\">Steve Bannon</a> was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA.

That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> referendum. These investigations are still continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. </p><p>While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. </p><p>The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”. </p><p>But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. </p><p>Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. </p><p>Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign.

Okay, maybe not for profit, but hopefully for fun.</p><p>Have you used a popular static site generator like Jekyll to generateyour blog? I have too. It is simple and great. But then did you yearnto use something even simpler to generate your blog? Do you like Python?Perhaps the thought of writing your own static site generator crossedyour mind but you thought it would be too much work? If you answered\"yes\" to these questions, then this project is for you.</p><p>With this project, you are in full control. There is no hidden magic!Everything is laid out in <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> as plain and simplePython code. It is just 125 lines of code (excluding blank linesand comments). It gets you off the ground pretty quickly. You can have adecent website/blog generated within a few minutes and then you canbegin tinkering with the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">source code</a>, the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout\">layout</a>, and the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/static/css/style.css\">css</a> to customize thelook and feel of your website to your satisfaction.</p><h2><a id=\"user-content-get-started\" href=\"#get-started\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Get Started</h2><p>This section provides some quick steps to get you off the ground asquickly as possible.</p><ol><li><p>For a quick demo on your local system, just enter this command:</p><pre><code>make serve</code></pre><p>If you don't have <code>make</code> but have Python 3.x, enter this command:</p><pre><code>python3 makesite.pycd _sitepython3 -m http.server</code></pre><p>Note: In some environments, you may need to use <code>python</code> instead of<code>python3</code> to invoke Python 3.x.</p><p>If you only have Python 2.7, enter this command:</p><pre><code>python makesite.pycd _sitepython -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></pre><p>Then visit <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost:8000/</a>. It should look like<a href=\"https://tmug.github.io/makesite-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p><p>Note: You can run <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> with Python 2.7 orPython 3.x.</p></li><li><p>You may see a few <code>Cannot render Markdown</code> warning messages in theoutput of the previous command. This is due to the fact that anexample <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/blog\">blog</a> in this project has a few posts writtenin Markdown. To render them correctly, install the <code>commonmark</code>package with this command:</p><pre><code>pip install commonmark</code></pre><p>Then try the previous step again.</p></li><li><p>For an Internet-facing website, you would be hosting the staticwebsite/blog on a hosting service and/or with a web server such asApache HTTP Server, Nginx, etc. You probably only need to generatethe static files and know where the static files are and move themto your hosting location.</p><p>If you have the <code>make</code> command, enter this command to generate yourwebsite:</p><pre><code>make site</code></pre><p>If you don't have <code>make</code> but have <code>python3</code>, enter this command:</p><pre><code>python3 makesite.py</code></pre><p>Note: In some environments, you may need to use <code>python</code> instead of<code>python3</code> to invoke Python 3.x.</p><p>If you only have <code>python</code>, enter this command:</p><pre><code>python makesite.py</code></pre><p>The <code>_site</code> directory contains the entire generated website. Thecontent of this directory may be copied to your website hostinglocation.</p></li></ol><h2><a id=\"user-content-the-code\" href=\"#the-code\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>The Code</h2><p>Now that you know how to generate the static website that comes withthis project, it is time to see what <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> does.You probably don't really need to read the entire section. The sourcecode is pretty self-explanatory but just in case, you need a detailedoverview of what it does, here are the details:</p><ol><li><p>The <code>main()</code> function is the starting point of website generation.It calls the other functions necessary to get the website generationdone.</p></li><li><p>First it creates a fresh new <code>_site</code> directory from scratch. Allfiles in the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/static\">static directory</a> are copied to thisdirectory. Later the static website is generated and written to thisdirectory.</p></li><li><p>Then it creates a <code>params</code> dictionary with some default parameters.This dictionary is passed around to other functions. These otherfunctions would pick values from this dictionary to populateplaceholders in the layout template files.</p><p>Let us take the <code>subtitle</code> parameter for example. It is setto our example website's fictitious brand name: \"Lorem Ipsum\". Wewant each page to include this brand name as a suffix in the title.For example, the <a href=\"https://tmug.github.io/makesite-demo/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">about page</a>has \"About - Lorem Ipsum\" in its title. Now take a look at the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> that is used as the layoutfor all pages in the static website. This layout file uses the<code>{{ subtitle }}</code> syntax to denote that it is a placeholder thatshould be populated while rendering the template.</p><p>Another interesting thing to note is that a content file canoverride these parameters by defining its own parameters in thecontent header. For example, take a look at the content file forthe <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/_index.html\">home page</a>. In its content header, i.e.,the HTML comments at the top with key-value pairs, it defines a newparameter named <code>title</code> and overrides the <code>subtitle</code> parameter.</p><p>We will discuss the syntax for placeholders and content headerslater. It is quite simple.</p></li><li><p>It then loads all the layout templates. There are 6 of them in thisproject.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">layout/page.html</a>: It contains the basetemplate that applies to all pages. It begins with<code><!DOCTYPE html></code> and <code><html></code>, and ends with <code></html></code>. The<code>{{ content }}</code> placeholder in this template is replaced withthe actual content of the page. For example, for the about page,the <code>{{ content }}</code> placeholder is replaced with the the entirecontent from <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/about.html\">content/about.html</a>. This isdone with the <code>make_pages()</code> calls further down in the code.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/post.html\">layout/post.html</a>: It contains the templatefor the blog posts. Note that it does not begin with <code><!DOCTYPE html></code> and does not contain the <code><html></code> and <code></html></code> tags.This is not a complete standalone template. This templatedefines only a small portion of the blog post pages that arespecific to blog posts. It contains the HTML code and theplaceholders to display the title, publication date, and authorof blog posts.</p><p>This template must be combined with the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> to create the finalstandalone template. To do so, we replace the <code>{{ content }}</code>placeholder in the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> withthe HTML code in the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/post.html\">post layout template</a> toget a final standalone template. This is done with the<code>render()</code> calls further down in the code.</p><p>The resulting standalone template still has a <code>{{ content }}</code>placeholder from the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/post.html\">post layout template</a>template. This <code>{{ content }}</code> placeholder is then replacedwith the actual content from the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/blog\">blog posts</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/list.html\">layout/list.html</a>: It contains the templatefor the blog listing page, the page that lists all the posts ina blog in reverse chronological order. This template does not domuch except provide a title at the top and an RSS link at thebottom. The <code>{{ content }}</code> placeholder is populated with thelist of blog posts in reverse chronological order.</p><p>Just like the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/post.html\">post layout template</a> , thistemplate must be combined with the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> to arrive at the finalstandalone template.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/item.html\">layout/item.html</a>: It contains the templatefor each blog post item in the blog listing page. The<code>make_list()</code> function renders each blog post item with thistemplate and inserts them into the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/list.html\">list layout template</a> to create the bloglisting page.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/feed.xml\">layout/feed.xml</a>: It contains the XML templatefor RSS feeds. The <code>{{ content }}</code> placeholder is populated withthe list of feed items.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/item.xml\">layout/item.xml</a>: It contains the XML template foreach blog post item to be included in the RSS feed. The<code>make_list()</code> function renders each blog post item with thistemplate and inserts them into the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/feed.xml\">layout/feed.xml</a> template to create thecomplete RSS feed.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>After loading all the layout templates, it makes a <code>render()</code> callto combine the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/post.html\">post layout template</a> with the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> to form the finalstandalone post template.</p><p>Similarly, it combines the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/list.html\">list layout template</a>template with the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/page.html\">page layout template</a> to formthe final list template.</p></li><li><p>Then it makes two <code>make_pages()</code> calls to render the home page and acouple of other site pages: the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/contact.html\">contact page</a>and the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/about.html\">about page</a>.</p></li><li><p>Then it makes two more <code>make_pages()</code> calls to render two blogs: onethat is named simply <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/blog\">blog</a> and another that is named<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/news\">news</a>.</p><p>Note that the <code>make_pages()</code> call accepts three positionalarguments:</p><ul><li>Path to content source files provided as a glob pattern.</li><li>Output path template as a string.</li><li>Layout template code as a string.</li></ul><p>These three positional arguments are then followed by keywordarguments. These keyword arguments are used as template parametersin the output path template and the layout template to replace theplaceholders with their corresponding values.</p><p>As described in point 2 above, a content file can override theseparameters in its content header.</p></li><li><p>Then it makes two <code>make_list()</code> calls to render the blog listingpages for the two blogs. These calls are very similar to the<code>make_pages()</code> calls. There are only two things that are differentabout the <code>make_list()</code> calls:</p><ul><li>There is no point in reading the same blog posts again that wereread by <code>make_pages()</code>, so instead of passing the path tocontent source files, we feed a chronologically reverse-sortedindex of blog posts returned by <code>make_pages()</code> to <code>make_list()</code>.</li><li>There is an additional argument to pass the<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout/item.html\">item layout template</a> as a string.</li></ul></li><li><p>Finally it makes two more <code>make_list()</code> calls to generate the RSSfeeds for the two blogs. There is nothing different about thesecalls than the previous ones except that we use the feed XMLtemplates here to generate RSS feeds.</p></li></ol><p>To recap quickly, we create a <code>_site</code> directory to write the static sitegenerated, define some default parameters, load all the layouttemplates, and then call <code>make_pages()</code> to render pages and blog postswith these templates, call <code>make_list()</code> to render blog listing pagesand RSS feeds. That's all!</p><p>Take a look at how the <code>make_pages()</code> and <code>make_list()</code> functions areimplemented. They are very simple with less than 20 lines of code each.Once you are comfortable with this code, you can begin modifying it toadd more blogs or reduce them. For example, you probably don't need anews blog, so you may delete the <code>make_pages()</code> and <code>make_list()</code> callsfor <code>'news'</code> along with its content at <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/news\">content/news</a>.</p><h2><a id=\"user-content-layout\" href=\"#layout\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Layout</h2><p>In this project, the layout template files are located in the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/layout\">layoutdirectory</a>. But they don't necessarily have to be there. You canplace the layout files wherever you want and update<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> accordingly.</p><p>The source code of <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> that comes with thisproject understands the notion of placeholders in the layout templates.The template placeholders have the following syntax:</p><pre><code>{{ <key> }}</code></pre><p>Any whitespace before <code>{{</code>, around <code><key></code>, and after <code>}}</code> is ignored.The <code><key></code> should be a valid Python identifier. Here is an example oftemplate placeholder:</p><pre><code>{{ title }}</code></pre><p>This is a very simple template mechanism that is implemented already inthe <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a>. For a simple website or blog, thisshould be sufficient. If you need a more sophisticated template enginesuch as <a href=\"http://jinja.pocoo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jinja2</a> or<a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cheetah</a>, you need to modify<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a> to add support for it.</p><h2><a id=\"user-content-content\" href=\"#content\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Content</h2><p>In this project, the content files are located in the <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content\">contentdirectory</a>. Most of the content files are written in HTML.However, the content files for the blog named <a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/content/blog\">blog</a> arewritten in Markdown.</p><p>The notion of headers in the content files is supported by<a href=\"/sunainapai/makesite/blob/master/makesite.py\">makesite.py</a>. Each content file may begin with one or moreconsecutive HTML comments that contain headers. Each header has thefollowing syntax:</p><pre><code><!-- <key>: <value> --></code></pre><p>Any whitespace before, after, and around the <code><!--</code>, <code><key></code>, <code>:</code>,<code><value></code>, and <code>--></code> tokens are ignored. Here are some example headers:</p><pre><code><!-- title: About --><!-- subtitle: Lorem Ipsum --><!-- author: Admin --></code></pre><p>It looks for the headers at the top of every content file. As soon assome non-header text is encountered, the rest of the content from thatpoint is not checked for headers.</p><h2><a id=\"user-content-credits\" href=\"#credits\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>Credits</h2><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/susam\">Susam</a> for writing thedocumentation and the unit tests.</p><h2><a id=\"user-content-license\" href=\"#license\"><svg><path></path></svg></a>License</h2><p>This is free and open source software.

Posts are written in markdown with Pygments highlighting for fenced code blocks. Posts also have JSON frontmatter which can #include other JSON data files, and this is where it gets Make-y: all affected pages get rebuilt when a data file changes with the help of a `gcc -M`-style file dependency scanner. I use these frontmatter &quot;data includes&quot; for site wide metadata and for data driven pages like post indexes. There&#x27;s also a dev server so you can quickly preview changes.<p>The biggest frustration I have with the Makefile + interpreted language approach is the slow startup time of interpreters these days.

How much of EBS provisioned capacity is unused, resulting in wasted spending, is a question asked often.</p><p>As it’s very difficult to know how much storage an application will need over its lifetime, most people tend to over-provision their storage as an insurance policy.  In the AWS cloud, however, you pay for what you provision, not for what you actually use.  While we at FittedCloud solve this problem with our <a href=\"https://www.fittedcloud.com/solutions/aws-ebs-optimization/\">EBS Optimizer</a> (which automatically and transparently provisions storage capacity for you) you may just want to simply know how much EBS space you are actually using.  Having this knowledge at your fingertips is helpful for cloud cost monitoring and cloud cost optimization.</p><p>Current approaches to determining your disk utilization involve running scripts on each instance that submit custom metrics to CloudWatch. This process involves:</p><ul><li>Deploying scripts on each of your instances</li><li>Submitting custom metrics to CloudWatch on each instance</li><li>Configuring cron jobs to run the script periodically on each instance</li></ul><p>Alternatively, you could use ssh to run commands remotely on Linux instances, however this approach would require juggling around key files and installing ssh servers on Windows instances.</p><p>At FittedCloud, we wanted a simpler, generic solution.</p><p>I’m pleased to announce the release of an open-source tool that you can use to fetch information about your disk utilization.  The script requires that Amazon’s AWS System Management Agent (SSM) is installed on your EC2 instances.  Among other things, the SSM Agent allows you to run shell commands remotely on your EC2 instances.</p><p>To use this tool:</p><p><strong>1. Install AWS SSM Agent on the instances you wish to query.</strong></p><p>If your instances are running Windows or Amazon Linux, SSM Agent is installed automatically so you can skip this step.  Otherwise, the instructions for installing the SSM Agent can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html</a>.</p><p><strong>2.

Many of Kikkuli's training methods are still considered sound and, in their time, they allowed the Hittites to become a mighty power rivaling Egypt.</p><p>Suppililiuma yearned for Hittite supremacy, leading to his acquisition of a large number of horses and the services of a leading Mitannian horse-master, Kikkuli. Kikkuli's training program produced superb horses for the Hittites. His methods were preserved on four clay, cuneiform tablets known as The Kikkuli Text.</p><p>Kikkuli used “interval” training, and stressed the leading of horses (from chariots) at a trot, canter and gallop, before subjecting them to the weight bearing stress of a rider or driver. The text detailed a seven month training regime. Rest days were scheduled, but workouts sometimes numbered three a day. Kikkuli’s interval training contained three stages – the first two for developing strong legs and a strong cardio-muscular system, and the third for increasing neuromuscular conditioning. His workouts included brief recoveries to lower the heart rate. Swimming was also included in intervals of three to five sessions, with rest periods after each session.</p><h4>Care and Feeding of the Chariot Horse</h4><h4>Kikkuli's Recipe for Equine Strength</h4><p>Day 2. Pace one league, run two furlongs (furlong = 1/8 mile). Feed two handfuls grass, one of clover, and four handfuls barley. Graze all night.</p><p>Day 3. Pace two and one half leagues (Hittite league = three miles), run two furlongs out. Run three furlongs, pace half a league home. Green grass at midday, followed by watering. Pace one league in evening. Feed grass and straw at night.</p><p>Day 4. Pace two leagues in morning, one at night. No water all day. Grass at night.</p><p>Day 5. Pace two leagues, run twenty furlongs out and thirty furlongs home. Put rugs on. After sweating, give one pail of salted water and one pail of malt-water. Take to river and wash down. Swim horses. Take to stable and give further pail of malted water and pail of salted water. Wash and swim again. Feed at night one bushel boiled with chaff.</p><p>Day 6. Wash five times in morning, graze in afternoon and wash once. Repeat for four days.</p><p>Day 12. Keep in stable all day. Feed only grain and cut grass. Repeat for 10 days.</p><p>Day 23. Wash in warm water. Feed grass. Repeat for seven days.</p><p>Day 31. Same for three days…</p><p>Day 34. Picketed outside stable all day without feed or water. Race three furlongs in evening, graze all night. Repeat three days.</p><p>Day 38. Swim morning, then pace two leagues. No day feed or water. Evening, pace nine furlongs. Night feed grass and straw. Repeat nine days.</p><h4>Fully Conditioned Horse</h4><p>Day 48. Stand up all day. One handful of grass mid-day. Evening, pace half a league. Water and grass at night.</p><p>Day 49. Pace half a league. Swim.</p><p>Day 50. Pace three leagues, run two furlongs. Grass at night.</p><p>Day 60. Pace nine furlongs, run (?) furlongs. Grass at night. Repeat nine times</p><p>Day 61. Pace seventeen furlongs, morning. Pace seventeen furlongs, run two furlongs, evening.</p><p>Day 62. Pace seventeen furlongs, run two furlongs. Wash, swim three times. Feed bushel boiled barley with chaff. Grass at night.</p><p>Day 63. Pace four leagues, run two furlongs. Repeat nine days. Bathe in hot water on fifth evening.</p><p>Day 73. Two handfuls of barley after morning work, with chaff. Pace half a league, run two furlongs, evening.</p><p>Day 74. Pace half a league, morning. Pace seventeen furlongs, evening, run three furlongs.</p><p>Day 75. Pace seventeen furlongs, run three furlongs. Wash, swim five times, feed grass after every other swim.

In early days, researchers toyed with various ways of making executable diagrams for programs: Humans would draw a diagram that communicated the program’s behaviour, and the computer would interpret it directly.</p><p>Another approach has been to dynamically generate diagrams and comments of one form or another. Many modern programming frameworks can generate documentation from the source code itself, sometimes using special annotations as a kind of markup. The value of this approach is that when the code changes, so does the documentation.</p><p>Can we generate state transition diagrams from our source code?</p><p>Well, we’re not going to write an entire graphics generation engine, although that would be a pleasant diversion. But what we will do is generate a kind of program that another engine can consume to produce our documentation.

Getting a list of states and events is easy. But what we don’t have is the starting state, nor do we have the states these methods (a/k/a “events”) transition to.</p><p>We could easily store the starting state for each state machine in a weak map. But what to do about the transitions? This is a deep problem. Throughout our programming explorations, we have repeatedly feasted on JavaScript’s ability for functions to consume other functions as arguments and return new functions. Using this, we have written many different kinds of decorators, including <code>transitionsTo</code>.</p><p>The beauty of functions returning functions is that closures form a hard encapsulation: The closure wrapping a function is available only functions created within its scope, not to any other scope. The drawback is that when we want to do some inspection, we cannot pierce the closure. We simply cannot tell from the function that <code>transitionsTo</code> returns what state it will transition to.</p><p>We have a few options. One is to use a different form of description that encodes the destination states without a <code>transitionsTo</code> function.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"a-new-old-kind-of-notation-for-bank-accounts\">a new-old kind of notation for bank accounts</h3><p>When <a href=\"http://raganwald.com/2018/02/23/forde.html\">we first formulated a notation for state machines</a>, we considered a more declarative format that encoded states and transitions using nested objects.

href=\"https://gist.github.com/raganwald/e4e92910e3039a5bd513cf36b6a7f95d#file-draw-diagrams-es6\">code</a>)</p><p>We can feed this <code>.dot</code> file to Graphviz, and it will produce the image we see right in this blog post, and that’s <em>exactly</em> how it was generated:</p><p>So. We now have a way of drawing state transition diagrams for state machines. Being able to extract the semantic structure of an object–like the state transitions for a state machine–is a useful kind of reflection, and one that exists at a higher semantic level than simply reporting on things like the methods an object responds to or the properties it has.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"should-a-state-machine-hide-the-fact-that-its-a-state-machine\">should a state machine hide the fact that it’s a state machine?</h3><p>People talk about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding\">information hiding</a> as separating the responsibility for an object’s “implementation” from its “interface.” The question here is whether an object’s states, transitions between states, and methods in each state are part of its implementation, or whether they are part of its interface, its contracted behaviour.</p><p>One way to tell is to ask ourselves whether changing those things will break other code. If we can change the transitions of a state machine without changing any other code in an app, it’s fair to say that the transitions are “just implementation details,” Just as changing a HashMap class to use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing\">Cuckoo Hash</a> instead of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\">Hash Table</a> doesn’t require us to change any of the code that interacts with our HashMap.</p><p>So how about our bank accounts? Consider the following sequence:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>account</span><span>.</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>//=> 0</span><span>account</span><span>.</span><span>deposit</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span><span>account</span><span>.</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>//=> ???</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Does the second <code>.availableToWithdraw()</code> return forty-two? Or zero? That depends upon whether the account is open or held, and that isn’t a private secret that only the account knows about. We know this, because people openly talk about whether accounts are open, held, or closed. People build processes around the account’s state, and it’s certainly part of the account’s design that the <code>.placeHold</code> method transitions an account into <code>held</code> state.</p><p>From this, we get that accounts should certainly <em>behave</em> like state machines. And from that, it’s reasonable that other pieces of code ought to be able to dynamically inspect an account’s current state, as well as its complete graph of states and transitions. That’s as much a part of its public interface as any particular method.<sup id=\"fnref:ofcourse\"></sup></p><p>It follows that in addition to our <code>ReflectiveStateMachine</code> function, we ought to also make both <code>getTransitions</code> and <code>getStateName</code> “public” functions that every other entity can interact with. <code>setState</code>, on the other hand, is best left as a “private” function: To preserve the proper business logic, other entities should invoke methods that perform the appropriate transitions, not directly change state.</p><p>We can even create public functions like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span>isStateMachine</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>return</span><span>MACHINES_TO_NAMES_TO_STATES</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>);</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div></div><p>So, now we have an understanding of a state machine, the behaviour it contractually guarantees, and how it might be organized such that it can expose its contract dynamically to other code.</p><p>But speaking of behaviour…</p><hr/><h3 id=\"its-never-as-simple-as-it-seems-in-a-blog-post\">it’s never as simple as it seems in a blog post</h3><p>One of the reasons we don’t see as many explicit state machines “in the wild” as we’d expect is that there is a perception that state machines are great when we’ve performed an exhaustive “Big Design Up Front” analysis, and have perfectly identified all of the states and transitions.</p><p>Many programmers believe that in a more agile, incremental process, we’re constantly <em>discovering</em> requirements and methods. We may not know that we have a state machine until later in the process, and things being messy, a domain model may not fit neatly into the state machine model even if it appears to have states.</p><p>For example, instead of being told that a bank account might be open, held, or closed, we might be told something different:</p><ul><li>A bank account is either open or closed;</li><li>An open bank account is either held or not held;</li></ul><p>So now we are told that an account doesn’t have one single state, it has two flags: open/closed and held/not-held. That doesn’t fit the state machine model at all, and refactoring it into open/held/closed may not be appropriate. This is an extremely simple example, but impedance mismatches like this are common, and over time a model may accrete a half-dozen or more toggles and enumerations that represent little states within the domain model’s larger state.</p><p>This is maddening, because we know how to model open/closed as a state machine, and if we didn’t have to worry about closed accounts, we also know how to model held/not-held as a state machine.</p><p>What to do?</p><hr/><h3 id=\"i-heard-you-liked-state-machines-so\">i heard you liked state machines, so…</h3><p>If we look at a bank account as having two flags, and between their possible settings there are three valid states, we don’t see a state machine. We see a stateful object. But hidden in our implementation is a clue as to how we can solve this semantically.</p><p>As implemented, state machines are objects that delegate their behaviour to a state object. There’s one state object for each possible state.</p><p>The state object for closed state has just one method, <code>reopen</code>. Our problem with the state object for <code>open</code> state is that it has two different behaviours, depending on whether the account is <code>held</code> or <code>not-held</code>.</p><p>That sounds very familiar!</p><p>What we are describing is that a bank account has two states. One of them, <code>closed</code>, is a simple object. But the other, <code>open</code>, is itself a state machine! It has two states, <code>held</code>, and <code>not-held</code>.</p><p>If we allow state object to be state machines, we can actually model our bank account exactly as our business users describe it.</p><p>But first, we’re going to need a bigger notation.<sup id=\"fnref:biggerboat\"></sup></p><hr/><h3 id=\"a-bigger-notation-for-state-machines\">a bigger notation for state machines</h3><p>Let’s look at what we want to model. For starters, we want an account that has <code>open</code> and <code>closed</code> states, and we want to describe what is guaranteed to be the case for each state:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>const</span><span>account</span><span>=</span><span>HierarchalStateMachine</span><span>({</span><span>balance</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>STARTING_STATE</span><span>]:</span><span>'open'</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>TRANSITIONS</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>open</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>deposit</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>=</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>+</span><span>amount</span><span>;</span><span>}</span><span>closed</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>close</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>></span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>// ...transfer balance to suspension account</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>},</span><span>closed</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>open</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>reopen</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>// ...restore balance if applicable</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>});</span></code></pre></div></div><p>And if we were thinking about a state machine nested <em>within</em> the <code>open</code> state, it would look like this:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>HierarchalStateMachine</span><span>({</span><span>[</span><span>STARTING_STATE</span><span>]:</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>TRANSITIONS</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>=</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>-</span><span>amount</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>return</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>></span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>held</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>placeHold</span><span>()</span><span>{}</span><span>}</span><span>},</span><span>held</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>return</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>[</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>removeHold</span><span>()</span><span>{}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>});</span></code></pre></div></div><p>It’s a state machine with two states. In <code>not-held</code>, it supports <code>withdraw</code>, <code>availableToWithdraw</code>, and <code>placewHold</code>. In <code>held</code>, it supports <code>availableToWithdraw</code> and <code>removeHold</code>. It does not need support deposit, because our top-level state machine does that.</p><p>So now, we need a way to put the second notation inside the first notation, perhaps like this:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>const</span><span>INNER</span><span>=</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>\"inner\"</span><span>);</span><span>const</span><span>account</span><span>=</span><span>HierarchalStateMachine</span><span>({</span><span>balance</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>STARTING_STATE</span><span>]:</span><span>'open'</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>TRANSITIONS</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>open</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>deposit</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>=</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>+</span><span>amount</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>closed</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>close</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>></span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>// ...transfer balance to suspension account</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>},</span><span>[</span><span>INNER</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>STARTING_STATE</span><span>]:</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>TRANSITIONS</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>=</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>-</span><span>amount</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>return</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>></span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>held</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>placeHold</span><span>()</span><span>{}</span><span>}</span><span>},</span><span>held</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>availableToWithdraw</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>return</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>},</span><span>[</span><span>'not-held'</span><span>]:</span><span>{</span><span>removeHold</span><span>()</span><span>{}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>},</span><span>closed</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>open</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>reopen</span><span>()</span><span>{</span><span>// ...restore balance if applicable</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>});</span></code></pre></div></div><hr/><h3 id=\"using-prototypical-inheritance-to-model-hierarchal-state-machines\">using prototypical inheritance to model hierarchal state machines</h3><p>Here’s what we want to happen: When an account enters <code>open</code> state, as per usual, its prototype will be set to its <code>open</code> state object. That will have a <code>deposit</code> and <code>close</code> method. But what will the <code>open</code> state object’s prototype be? Ah! That will be the inner state machine that has <code>held</code> and <code>not-held</code> methods. And every time the object enters the <code>open</code> state, the inner state machine will enter the <code>not-held</code> state.</p><p>So the prototype chain will look something like this:</p><div><div><pre><code>account -> open -> open.inner -> open.inner.not-held</code></pre></div></div><p>If the account is held, it will change to:</p><div><div><pre><code>account -> open -> open.inner -> open.inner.held</code></pre></div></div><p>And if it is closed, it will change to:</p><div><div><pre><code>account -> closed</code></pre></div></div><p>The first thing we’re going to need is to slightly modify our state machine to take a prototype as an argument, and then make sure that every <code>stateObject</code> we create for it points to that prototype:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span>HierarchalStateMachine</span><span>(</span><span>description</span><span>,</span><span>prototype</span><span>=</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span>// ...</span><span>for</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span>state</span><span>of</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>(</span><span>MACHINES_TO_TRANSITIONS</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>machine</span><span>)))</span><span>{</span><span>const</span><span>stateObject</span><span>=</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>prototype</span><span>);</span><span>// ...</span><span>}</span><span>// ...</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Armed with this, we can look for <code>[INNER]</code> in any state description.

In addition to formalizing hierarchal state machines, statechart notation covers many other important topics like concurrency and parallel execution.</p><p>Harel’s <a href=\"https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf\">original paper</a> explains the entire idea.</p><p>Statecharts have a formal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCXML\">SCXML</a> notation, and a number of actively maintained libraries implementing executable statecharts, including <a href=\"http://davidkpiano.github.io/xstate/docs/#/\">xstate</a>, which bills itself as “functional, stateless JavaScript finite state machines and statecharts.” You may also want to take a look at the delightfully readable (but unfinished) <a href=\"https://statecharts.github.io\">statecharts.github.io</a> project. There’s plenty to review in Wikipedia’s article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine\">UML State Machines</a> as well.</p><p>There’s a lot to digest!</p><p>But we’ve gotten the general idea, and that is enough for now. Now that we’ve done the work, let’s turn to the most pressing question: What is it good for? Why should we care?</p><hr/><h3 id=\"rubber-duck-design\">rubber duck design</h3><p>Hierarchal state machines seem like an awful lot of work for a model with a handful of methods, but let’s take a step back and think about the general principles involved. First, hierarchal state machines help us model the way people think about states more closely than if we had to translate what they are saying to a simple “flat” state machine.</p><p>Second, hierarchal state machines open up opportunities for <em>composing</em> state machines out of smaller parts. Being able to decompose and recompose models is a programming superpower.</p><p>Third, having a “meta-model”–whether it be hierarchal state machines or flat state machines–for constructing domain models provides an unexpected process benefit we might call “Rubber Duck Design.”</p><blockquote><p>In software engineering, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\">rubber duck debugging</a> or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.</p><p>Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem.</p></blockquote><p>Rubber duck <em>design</em> works just like rubber duck debugging: The act of explaining the design prompts our brains to think through the thing we’re modelling more thoroughly than if we just stare at the code. What makes state machines–whether hierarchal or flat–particularly effective for this is that they force us to “explain to the computer” all of the states and transitions the entity we’re modelling will have.</p><p>As an incredibly fecund bonus, we also get dynamically generated diagrams and a cleaner form of self-documenting code in the form of the descriptions that makes it easier for others to read and modify our domain objects.</p><p>Whether we use the complete and rather heavyweight SCXML or build ourself a lightweight alternative, in many cases, modelling domain objects as state machines is a win.</p><p>(discuss on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/846cb8/more_state_machine_from_reflection_to_statecharts/\">reddit</a>)</p><hr/><h3 id=\"javascript-allongé-the-six-edition\">javascript allongé, the six edition</h3><p>If you enjoyed this essay, you’ll ❤️ <a href=\"http://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/c/state-machines\">JavaScript Allongé, the Six Edition</a>.

The ID cards are given to every enrolled student and can be used at nearly 700 campus locations including vending machines, libraries, labs, residence halls, the student union center, and movie theaters.</p><p>They also have an embedded sensor that can be used to track geographic history whenever the card is swiped. These data are fed into an analytics system that finds “highly accurate indicators” of potential dropouts, according to a <a href=\"https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/ua-looks-digital-traces-help-students\">press release</a> last week from the university. “By getting [student’s] digital traces, you can explore their patterns of movement, behavior and interactions, and that tells you a great deal about them,” Sudha Ram, a professor of management systems, and director of the program, said in the release. “It’s really not designed to track their social interactions, but you can, because you have a timestamp and location information,” Ram added.</p><p>For an example of how granular those data points can get, take Ram’s explanation of social tracking: “There are several quantitative measures you can extract from these networks, like the size of [students’] social circle, and we can analyze changes in these networks to see if their social circle is shrinking or growing, and if the strength of their connections is increasing or decreasing over time.”</p><p>The University of Arizona currently generates lists of likely dropouts from 800 data points, which do not yet include Ram’s research but include details like demographic information and financial aid activity. Those lists, made several times a year, are shared with college advisers so they can intervene before it’s too late. The schools says the lists are 73% accurate and Ram’s research yields 85% to 90% accuracy, though it did not give details on how those rates are measured.</p><p>The University of Arizona freshman retention rate jumped from 80.5% to 83.3% last year—so its so-called “Smart Campus” project appears to be useful.

The university will have to contend with these issues and others before it expands the program, and particularly if it has aims to use Smart Campus to actively make decisions about students instead of just spitting out predictive lists.</p><hr/><p><strong>Read next: <a href=\"https://qz.com/1070119/the-future-of-the-university-is-in-the-air-and-in-the-cloud/\">It’s the end of the university as we know it</a></strong></p><div><aside><article><h4>Most Popular</h4><figure><a href=\"https://qz.com/1230951/when-will-black-people-finally-get-their-metoo-moment/\" title=\"When will black people finally get their #metoo moment?\"><img src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/rtsh0x4-e1521221324897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=240\" alt=\"People walk over the names of people killed by police as they take part in a protest against the killing of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and in support of Black Lives Matter during a march along Manhattan's streets in New York July 8, 2016.\"/></a></figure></article></aside></div></div><div><div><a title=\"Share on twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1226474&text=A%20US%20university%20is%20tracking%20students%E2%80%99%20locations%20to%20predict%20future%20dropouts&via=qz\"></a><a title=\"Share on facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1226474%2Fa-us-university-is-tracking-students-locations-to-predict-future-dropouts%2F&caption=qz.com%20%7C%20By%20Amy%20X.%20Wang\"></a><a title=\"Share on linkedin\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1226474%2Fa-us-university-is-tracking-students-locations-to-predict-future-dropouts%2F&title=A%20US%20university%20is%20tracking%20students%E2%80%99%20locations%20to%20predict%20future%20dropouts&summary=At%20the%20University%20of%20Arizona%2C%20school%20officials%20know%20when%20students%20are%20going%20to%20drop%20out%20before%20they%20do.%20The%20public%20college%20in%20Tucson%20has%20been%E2%80%A6&source=Quartz\"></a><a title=\"Share on email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz%3A%20A%20US%20university%20is%20tracking%20students%E2%80%99%20locations%20to%20predict%20future%20dropouts&body=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1226474%2Fa-us-university-is-tracking-students-locations-to-predict-future-dropouts%2F%0A%0AAt%20the%20University%20of%20Arizona%2C%20school%20officials%20know%20when%20students%20are%20going%20to%20drop%20out%20before%20they%20do.%20The%20public%20college%20in%20Tucson%20has%20been%E2%80%A6%0A%0ASign%20up%20for%20the%20Quartz%20Daily%20Brief%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fquartzdailybrief.\"></a><a title=\"Share on whatsapp\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=A%20US%20university%20is%20tracking%20students%E2%80%99%20locations%20to%20predict%20future%20dropouts%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1226474%2Fa-us-university-is-tracking-students-locations-to-predict-future-dropouts%2F\"></a></div></div><button>Read full story</button></div></div>","score":42,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521325705,"text":"This article, and most of the discussion here, appears to be conflating two things.\n1.

I’m writing this article with vim, in aterminal emulator called urxvt, listening to music with mpv, in a Sway desktopsession, on the Linux kernel. Supporting this are libraries like glibc or musl,harfbuzz, and mesa. I also have the support of the AMDGPU video driver, libinputand udev, alsa and pulseaudio.</p><p>All of this is open source. I can be reading the code for any of these toolswithin 30 seconds, and for many of these tools I already have their code checkedout somewhere on my filesystem. It gets even better, though: these projectsdon’t just make their code available - they accept patches, too! Why wouldn’t wetake advantage of this tremendous opportunity?</p><p>I often meet people who are willing to contribute to one project, but notanother. Some people will shut down when they’re faced with a problem thatrequires them to dig into territory that they’re unfamiliar with. In Sway, forexample, it’s often places like libinput or mesa. These tools might seem foreignand scary - but to these people, at some point, so did Sway. In reality thesecodebases are quite accessible.</p><p>Getting around in an unfamiliar repository can be a little intimidating, but doit enough times and it’ll become second nature. The same tools like gdb workjust as well on them. If you have a stacktrace for a segfault originating inlibinput, compile libinput with symbols and gdb will show you the file name andline number of the problem. Go there and read the code! Learn how to use toolslike <code>git grep</code> to find stuff. Run <code>git blame</code> to see who wrote a confusing lineof code, and send them an email! When you find the problem, don’t be afraid tosend a patch over instead of working around it in your own code. This issomething every programmer should be comfortable doing often.</p><p>Even when the leads you’re chasing down are written in unfamiliar programminglanguages or utilize even more unfamiliar libraries, don’t despair. Allprogramming languages have a lot in common and huge numbers of resources areavailable online. Learning just enough to understand (and fix!) a particularproblem is very possible, and something I find myself doing it all the time. Youdon’t have to be an expert in a particular programming language to invoke trial& error.</p><p>If you’re similarly worried about the time investment, don’t be. You already setaside time to work your problem, and this is just part of that process. Yes,you’ll probably be spending your time differently from your expectations - morereading code than writing code. But how is that any less productive? Thebiggest time sink in this process is all the time you spend worrying about howmuch time it’s going to take, or telling me in IRC you can’t solve your problembecause you’re not good enough to understand mesa or the kernel or whatever.</p><p>An important pastime of the effective programmer is reading and understandingthe tools you use. You should at least have a basic idea of how everything onyour system works, and in the places your knowledge is lacking you should makeit your business to study up.

He doesn’t need to slow down. <em>You</em> need to speed up.”</p><p>It was a surprising recommendation from someone who had never learned to use a microwave. But recent research suggests she had a point: Some people with A.D.H.D. may be naturally suited to our turbocharged world.</p><p>Today the word “hyperactive” doesn’t just describe certain individuals; it also is a quality of our society. We are bombarded each day by four times the number of words we encountered daily when my mother was raising me. Even vacations are complicated — people today use, on average, 26 websites to plan one. Attitudes and habits are changing so fast that you can identify “generational” differences in people just a few years apart: Simply by analyzing daily cellphone communication patterns, researchers have been able to guess the age of someone under 60 to within about five years either way with 80 percent accuracy.</p><p>To thrive in this frenetic world, certain cognitive tendencies are useful: to embrace novelty, to absorb a wide variety of information, to generate new ideas. The possibility that such characteristics might be associated with A.D.H.D. was first examined in the 1990s. The educational psychologist Bonnie Cramond, for example, tested a group of children in Louisiana who had been determined to have A.D.H.D. and found that an astonishingly high number — 32 percent — did well enough to qualify for an elite creative scholars program in the Louisiana schools.</p><p>It is now possible to explain Professor Cramond’s results at the neural level. While there is no single brain structure or system responsible for A.D.H.D. (and some believe the term encompasses more than a single syndrome), one cause seems to be a disruption of the brain’s dopamine system. One consequence of that disruption is a lessening of what is called “cognitive inhibition.” The human brain has a system of filters to sort through all the possible associations, notions and urges that the brain generates, allowing only the most promising ones to pass into conscious awareness. That’s why if you are planning a trip to Europe, you think about flying there, but not swimming.</p><p>But odd and unlikely associations can be valuable. When such associations survive filtering, they can result in constructive ideas that wouldn’t otherwise have been thought of. For example, when researchers apply a technique known as transcranial stimulation to interfere with key structures in the filtering system, people become more imaginative and inventive, and more insightful as problem solvers.</p><p>Individuals with A.D.H.D. naturally have less stringent filters. This can make them more distractible but also more creative. Such individuals may also adapt well to frequent change and thus make for good explorers. Jews whose ancestors migrated north to Rome and Germany from what is now Israel and the Palestinian territories show a higher proportion of the A.D.H.D. gene variant than those Jews whose ancestors migrated a shorter distance south to Ethiopia and Yemen. In fact, scientists have found that the farther a group’s ancestors migrated, the higher the prevalence of the gene variant in that population.</p><p>Or consider the case of the Ariaal, a Kenyan tribe whose members through most of its history were wild-animal herders. A few decades ago, some of its members split off from the main group and became farmers.</p><p>Being a wild-animal herder is a good job if you are naturally restless; subsistence farming is a far tamer occupation. Recently, the anthropologist Dan Eisenberg and collaborators studied whether people with A.D.H.D. might thrive in the former lifestyle but suffer in the latter. They found that among the herders, those who possessed a gene that predisposed them to A.D.H.D. were, on average, better nourished. Among the farming Ariaal, the opposite was true: Those who lacked the genetic predisposition for A.D.H.D. were, on average, better nourished. Restlessness seemed to better suit a restless existence.</p><p>A.D.H.D. is termed a disorder, and in severe forms it can certainly disrupt a person’s life. But you might view a more moderate degree of A.D.H.D. as an asset in today’s turbulent and fast-changing world. My mother, now 95, long ago realized that speed is the essence of our era. Her intuition about Nicolai proved correct, and she has lived to watch her grandson thrive without taking the A.D.H.D. medication she was dead set against.</p><div><div><p>Leonard Mlodinow is a physicist and the author of the forthcoming book “Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change,” from which this article is adapted.</p><p><em>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion\">Twitter (@NYTopinion)</a>, and sign up for the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/\"> Opinion Today newsletter</a>. <br/></em></p></div><div>A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR8 of the New York edition with the headline: In Praise of A.D.H.D.<span>. <a href=\"http://www.nytreprints.com/\">Order Reprints</a> | <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html\">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY\">Subscribe</a></span></div></div><span></span><span></span><div id=\"bottom-wrapper\"><div id=\"bottom-slug\"><p>Advertisement</p></div><div></div></div></div></div>","score":76,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521307715,"text":"I&#x27;m lugging around an ADD diagnosis from my teenage years, complete with years of taking stimulants, followed by years of rejecting stimulants, and embracing self-therapy, so I have plenty of opinions, as one could imagine. But I&#x27;d like to describe my own experience of what having ADD is like.<p>Imagine a scheduler that has many tasks to schedule, and more incoming work than it can schedule in a timely fashion. The scheduler is designed to consider all tasks, but will give a higher priority to tasks that provide immediate feedback.<p>A consequence of this design is that tasks which require a lot of time to complete, but provide little to no feedback until after the task is completed, are typically starved for resources. Often, they will never complete, or even start running.<p>Well, that&#x27;s basically how my brain worked before I started exerting control over it. I would flip from thought to thought, lingering on things that provided immediate feedback, like playing musical instruments or video games.<p>Planning is a difficult task when your brain works that way. I had to consciously focus attention away from things that I was seemingly wired to fixate on. Even determined concentration was hampered by constant context switching, which I felt I had little control over.<p>ADD is a chronic condition, and I still have to deal with this on a daily basis. But it has gotten easier. Luckily, I&#x27;ve been able to develop enough coping techniques to at least take care of myself.<p>Most people who know me assume that I am very high functioning. As a software developer, I am pretty successful, and people equate that with intense concentration and process-oriented thinking.

They wrestle away the execution time from each other. They spontaneously explode or implode. Nothing corrals them, nothing gives a policy for deciding which one to devote time and effort to.<p>No matter how hard you lecture the CPUs for being lazy, it never changes the behaviour of unscheduled and unschedulable threads. But it sure can make you feel bad.<p>You say you&#x27;ve been lugging around the diagnosis since being a teenager. I was diagnosed at 32. Medication has been liberating.

Like living a toothbrush lying by the sink, putting vitamins in a 7-day pill thing for the week, etc.<p>- I have have 11 bank accounts, each with a single purpose, and I have automatic transfers set up between all of them (it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty good).  I prevent overdrawing a checking account by using a pre-paid debit card that won&#x27;t let me take the balance below zero.

Live and die by the calendar, because you will never remember things on your own.<p>* Know what you&#x27;re aiming to do on a day. Maybe you can cope with a to-do list, but speaking for myself they feel oppressive, like I am judging myself for all the things I&#x27;ve failed to do. But you can keep <i>one</i> thing in mind.<p>* Email yourself! I bat tasks back and forth between my home and work emails, based on where I can act on them.<p>* Exercise. It helps with a lot of things and research suggests it helps with ADHD as well.<p>* It&#x27;s the morning. You&#x27;ve made coffee. You should be preparing to do some exercise. <i>Don&#x27;t open the laptop or phone</i>. I know you&#x27;re going to &quot;just check&quot;. Don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t start, you won&#x27;t stop.<p>* When you learn about something that distracts you easily, either give up the addiction or accept the cost. I&#x27;ve pissed away thousands of hours of my life on websites like this one. I have mixed feelings about what I gained and lost. Right now I am noticing that Slack is becoming a problem for me.<p>* Read books. Physical books lack the ability to open tabs or follow links.<p>* Have times of day when you ignore things. At work I generally ignore messages on my phone. At home I ignore emails from work. In particular, there is no way for my work to reach me on my phone. No email, no slack, nothing.<p>* Work in pairs! This has been phenomenal for me.<p>* Do you take shorter-acting medication, like I do? Set an alarm for the doses you need later in the day. Left to my own devices I can easily sail past 2pm and then at 4pm wonder why the hellSQUIRREL I can&#x27;t conCLANGcentrate on my wWIKIPEDIAork.<p>* You will struggle with impulse buys. Rehearse in your mind what it will be like when you get the thing. Think about the regret of having given into the impulse. Even a few seconds of delay can break it.<p>There are probably other coping mechanisms I don&#x27;t realise are coping mechanisms.<p>These are not enough by themselves. Not even close.

Having a reliable routine means I am never lost for what I should be doing or where I should be. I don&#x27;t organise because I am prone to perfectly planning everything -- I organise because I&#x27;m dysfunctional without it. For example: every Friday is laundry day. Anything that misses the Friday slot has to wait for next Friday.<p>* Don&#x27;t stock your favourite foods. Everyone lives with temptations, but ADHD makes it that much harder to resist. I have a number of foods which I love and which I simply do not have in my home. No chocolate, no peanut butter, no bread, no pasta. I have these occasionally and as a treat. But if they are around they will get eaten. So I just don&#x27;t keep them.<p>* Don&#x27;t know your passwords. Use a program like keepass. If you know the passwords for sites and apps, you will log into them from more places.<p>* Go to an office to work, whatever &quot;office&quot; means to you. Make the hours regular. Try to create a distinct physical separation. The difference makes it easier to enforce rules about what you can do when.<p>* You see a topic on reddit, hackernews etc that you deeply care about. Don&#x27;t open it. Don&#x27;t read the comments. You&#x27;ll struggle to stay out and -- as you can see from my comments elsewhere under this post -- struggle to control your emotions. Just stay away. That&#x27;s what I should&#x27;ve done with this one.<p>* Don&#x27;t take breaks if you&#x27;re making forward progress. People say to take breaks, but in my experience it pretty much ensures you will derail the rest of your time. Right now, for example, I&#x27;m in about the 4th hour of a 5 minute break.<p>* Do your best on sleep hygiene. Being tired weakens your ability to resist impulse still further. You will say and do more things you&#x27;ll wish you hadn&#x27;t.<p>* Get a filing cabinet. Add folders. Get stuff off your desk as fast as you can. Empty your email inbox as completely as you can.<p>* Subject to your finances, pay your bills ASAP. You will forget them. Or worse: forget them, remember them, feel stressed about forgetting them, then forget them, over and over until they&#x27;re paid.<p>Between ADHD, anxiety and depression, just being alive is exhausting.

If I can fixate on one thing to center a schedule around, I find keeping plans much easier.<p>- Exercising for 30 minutes or more everyday, as early in the day as possible.

Most psychiatrists make money off of volume of patients. So it is in their best interest to prescribe more and consult less. The more patients that come through their office and they prescribe meds to the more money they make. He used the example of the psychiatry department at the public hospital next door to his office.

The store’s impresario, Bill Ziegler, collected the flotsam and jetsam of pop culture: At Wild Bill’s, you could buy old-school posters, bobblehead dolls, old records, old books, lunch boxes, toy cars, dolls, and more. He had a knack for finding one-of-a-kind objects—Pee-wee Herman’s bike, a portrait of P.T. Barnum, a mechanized clown. The artists who had come through, working odd jobs and taking up informal residencies, had their work on display, too. Outside, a fun house was in the works.</p><p>Last April, in the weeks after Ziegler died unexpectedly at age 70, Heather Page, his daughter and longtime store manager, was trying to figure out <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wild-bills-nostalgia-family-roadside-attraction\">how to keep Wild Bill’s open</a> and its spirit alive. There was a concert celebrating Wild Bill’s life and a general sense of “Let’s keep this place going,” as Joe McCarthy, an artist who had worked with Ziegler for years, put it.</p><p>But now the future of the Connecticut nostalgia emporium is murky.</p><p>“We’re closed,” Page tells a group of National Guard members who come by the door on a Wednesday afternoon. She doesn’t want to be saying this; she wants to let them in. But it’s not up to her anymore.</p><figure><img src=\"//assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png\" alt=\"Inside, the store is now being re-inventoried. \" id=\"article-image-52642\"/><figcaption>Inside, the store is now being re-inventoried.</figcaption></figure><p>In November, after a family dispute over control of Ziegler’s estate, a Connecticut probate court appointed an independent administrator to manage its assets, which include the business. Since then, the retail store’s hours have been cut back, and are now down to just Friday to Sunday. Page and the other staff are no longer buying anything new, but just re-inventorying the extensive stock with the aim of creating a new catalog for retail and wholesale. The type of quirky concerts and events that Wild Bill used to host are not part of the vision for the business’ immediate future.</p><p>“Today I turned 10 different people away,” says Page. “I have to watch people come up to the store and [I have to] say we’re not open. It breaks my heart.”</p><p>Businesses like Wild Bill’s, which are formed around the passion and personality of a unusual individual, can be hard to keep alive over the long term, even when the founder is still alive. And when the visionary passes on, and a family disagrees over how to run their inheritance, the chances of survival become slimmer still.</p><p>“We’re all hoping that things are working out and that we can continue,” says Page. But the probate process, which includes paying off the estate’s debts and dividing assets among Ziegler’s three children, will not be complete for some time, so it is hard to say what will become of the place itself.</p><figure><img src=\"//assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png\" alt=\"Moving the Yugos would be a challenge.\" id=\"article-image-52641\"/><figcaption>Moving the Yugos would be a challenge.</figcaption></figure><p>The assets of Wild Bill’s Nostalgia aren’t quite like those of most businesses, which further complicates the legal process. Out front, for instance, is a giant sculpture of three cars seemingly balanced on circus balls. Originally named <em>I’d Go Where Yugo Stanley Marsh 3</em> (a reference to Stanley Marsh 3’s iconic Cadillac Ranch, which features 10 cars half-buried in the ground), the sculpture came from the fact that there were somehow three <a href=\"http://www.librarypoint.org/yugo_vuic\">Yugo cars</a> on the property (two of which had been left at the store because that’s the sort of thing people did for Wild Bill). After McCarthy proposed his idea for this sculpture, Ziegler paid him for the costs and the time of creating it. When it was complete, they agreed that McCarthy would own half and Ziegler the other half.</p><p>If Wild Bill’s were to close, it’s not clear what would happen to pieces of art like this and the other (some similarly gigantic) sculptures made here. “The hardest part would be finding a new home for the Yugos,” McCarthy says. “It’s a big piece that’s going to be expensive to move. But really the same could be said for most of the work on the property.”</p><p>In the past, part of what made Wild Bill’s Nostalgia a special place was these sort of improbable, impractical projects, which functioned as round-about investments because they attracted people to the store to spend money. Under the supervision of a fiduciary, there’s little room for that sort of creative marketing.</p><p>“The dream that my dad had was to make people happy. And to treat life not as seriously as it needs to be treated, and to have fun, and pique people’s curiosity,” Page says. “I’m devastated by the way things are changing. If this all goes away, it’s a bigger loss than just losing my dad. I’m losing my whole identity, and that’s a lot to take in.”</p></div></div>","score":26,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521321525,"text":"This headline is the rare opposite of a click bait headline given how good I found the content to be.

Intended to familiarize general audiences with the man behind classic paintings like <em>Nighthawks </em>and <em>Early Sunday Morning</em>, the resultant profile reads today like a paean to an American master. Eliot was taken with Hopper’s “unalterable reserve.” Presenting the artist as a frugal and unsentimental old man who often conflated self-effacement and self-flagellation, he painted his own portrait of a folksy messiah—a humble savant capable of rescuing American realism from a clique of “clattering egos.”</p><p>Given this messianic tilt, it’s not surprising that as Eliot broached Hopper’s early days as a commercial artist, he referred to the period as his “time in the desert.” For the first 25 years of his career, Eliot related, Hopper had failed to support himself solely on his painting and therefore paid his bills drawing covers and interior art for publications like <em>Hotel Management</em>, <em>Everybody’s Magazine</em>, and the <em>Wells Fargo Messenger. </em>Eliot spun this existence into a retroactive tragedy. Advertising firms and publishing houses had wanted America’s greatest living realist to “draw storybook characters posturing and grimacing.” Hopper had simply wanted to “paint sunlight on the side of a house.”</p><span><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Edward-Hopper-Everbody-magazine.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Hopper Everbody magazine\" srcset=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Edward-Hopper-Everbody-magazine.jpg 650w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Edward-Hopper-Everbody-magazine-300x270.jpg 300w\"/> From the July 1919 issue of <em>Everybody’s Magazine</em>.</span><p>To Eliot’s credit, 60 years later, art historians still struggle to reconcile the most sensational of Hopper’s commercial illustrations with the quiescent scenes that earned him a place among the great 20th-century artists. Hopper biographer Gail Levin described this squaring-up process in 1979; while many of the artist’s commissioned illustrations allowed him to perfect subjects “in which he was especially prolific”—offices, ships, railroads, hotels, and restaurant scenes—several forced him to confront unfamiliar and at times uncomfortable themes.</p><div><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1482941823113-0\"></div></div><span>“Art historians still struggle to reconcile the most sensational of Hopper’s commercial illustrations with the quiescent scenes that earned him a place among the great 20th-century artists.”</span><p>Nowhere was this more evident than in his work for the pulp-fiction magazine <em>Adventure</em>.</p><p>Between March 1916 and March 1919, Hopper illustrated five issues for the publication. In these magazines, the famed realist—a man whose plaintive portraits and landscapes now sell for tens of millions of dollars—drew heading art for stories like “The Sourdough Twins’ Last Clean-Up,” “Snuffy and the Monster,” and “A Fish Story About Love.” Hopper enlivened these stories with images that ranged from amusing to maudlin. One illustration, perched above Holda Sears’ “The Finish,” shows an explorer in a life-and-death struggle with a man-sized python. Another, atop Hapsburg Liebe’s “Alias John Doe,” depicts two cowboys “tabletopping” a patsy—one of his subjects kneeling behind their victim while the other topples him over. Additional pictures portray rampaging apes, spear-wielding natives, and pioneers wearing coonskin caps.</p><span><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-95.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-95.jpg 750w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-95-300x137.jpg 300w\"/> From the July 18th, 1918 issue of <em>Adventure.</em></span><p>According to pulp-fiction historian Richard Bleiler, such diverse subject matter was typical of a catch-all mentality that made <em>Adventure</em>—the first issue of which hit newsstands in October 1910—one of the most successful of the early pulps. Though later competitors succeeded by specializing in specific genres, <em>Adventure</em> thrived by harboring a catholic mentality, which focused on wide-ranging stories about treasure hunters, espionage, crime, and exploration. From the start, readers responded to this approach. “<em>Adventure </em>had enormous newsstand sales as well as many subscribers,” Bleiler says. “The magazine had sufficient funds that it could do such things as issue identification cards for its fans and even sponsor an expedition to Abyssinia [modern day Ethiopia].”</p><p>Hopper’s work for the magazine came during its halcyon days under the stewardship of editor Arthur Sullivant Hoffman. Far from an arriviste, Hoffman was, by the time he signed Hopper’s paychecks, a well-connected and well-respected editor. His acquaintances at the time included novelists Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis, the latter of whom also worked at <em>Adventure </em>between 1911 and 1913. According to Bleiler, Hoffman’s demanding standards set his magazine apart from other pulps.</p><span><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-148.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-148.jpg 700w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-148-300x144.jpg 300w\"/> From the July 18th, 1918 issue of <em>Adventure.</em></span><p>“A writer had to write well and know whereof she or he wrote,” he says. “This sounds silly and self-obvious, and today perhaps it is, but this was not always the case. Hoffman’s <em>Adventure</em> showed that literary sensationalism did not have to involve pandering or cliché writing.”</p><p>To Hopper, of course, none of this mattered. During this period, he took only as much illustrating work as needed, and he seems not to have differentiated <em>Adventure </em>from other paying magazines like <em>Farmer’s Wife, Country Gentlemen</em>, or even <em>Scribner’s</em>. According to Carter Foster, deputy director for curatorial affairs at the Blanton Museum of Art and author of the book <em>Hopper Drawing</em>, Hopper despised illustrating no matter the client. “He took the work seriously insofar as he was a great artist and could certainly do it well,” Foster says. “But he didn’t like other people telling him what to draw or paint—he liked to come up with his own subjects.”</p><p>As Levin wrote in 1979, Hopper’s attitude toward illustrating was “the antithesis of that of popular illustrator Norman Rockwell.” He never aimed to elevate illustration to a high-brow artform, nor did he view the work as anything more than a paycheck. Hopper himself described this mindset to Eliot in 1956. As a freelancer, he recalled, he often dropped by unannounced at a publication’s office with a portfolio tucked beneath his arm. “Sometimes I’d walk around the block a couple of times before I’d go in,” Hopper said, “wanting the job for money and at the same time hoping to hell I wouldn’t get the lousy thing.”</p><span><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Hopper-Adventure.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Hopper-Adventure.png 800w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Hopper-Adventure-300x125.png 300w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Hopper-Adventure-768x319.png 768w\"/> From the March 3rd, 1919 issue of <em>Adventure.</em></span><p>As to what Hopper’s illustrations for stories like “The Roughneck,” “The Two-Gun Girl,” and “The Dance of the Golden Gods” contribute to his greater legacy, Foster believes they demonstrate how his talent bled through even when restricted by house style guides. Though Hopper did not put the same level of effort into these drawings as he did other artwork, he “was a keen observer of human emotion and behavior, and this can certainly come through in his illustrations.”</p><p>More importantly, Foster argues, the critical tendency to identify incongruity between his illustration work and the realism for which he is now known is itself misguided. “His work is closer to surrealism or magic realism,” he says. “Although he carefully observed the world to get material for his art, he always molded and changed this to create his own subjective vision.”</p><span><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-169.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-169.jpg 800w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-169-300x156.jpg 300w, https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adventure-v018-n02-1918-07-18-1-169-768x400.jpg 768w\"/> From the July 18th, 1918 issue of Adventure.</span><p>Luckily for Hopper, a sold out 1924 watercolor show soon freed him to explore this vision without financial restraint. Though he still sold an occasional illustration over the next three years, he never again relied on the trade for a living. The further he removed himself from this work, the more reluctant he grew to talk about it, and, by the time he spoke to Eliot in 1956, his attitude toward illustration had fully hardened into regret and resentment. Evidence suggests, however, that this was not always the case.</p><p>In 1979, Levin discovered an article Hopper published in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=J_VGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22edward+hopper%22+and+%22john+sloan+and+the+philadelphians%22&source=bl&ots=uk56k5jwKw&sig=a6R2GAtswK3LTFPRGm3lZ8vwhFk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvjcyzyY_ZAhWRy1MKHdnSBBsQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&q=%22edward%20hopper%22%20and%20%22john%20sloan%20and%20the%20philadelphians%22&f=false\">the April 1927 edition of <em>The Arts</em></a>. Written about the career of his old friend, John Sloan, the essay, according to Levin, reflected a tacit acknowledgment from Hopper that his own years as an illustrator had played a significant role in his growth as an artist.</p><span>“Hopper saw virtue in Sloan’s illustrations where he found only shame in his own.”</span><p>“John Sloan’s development,” he wrote, “has followed the common lot of the painter who through necessity starts his career as a draughtsman and illustrator: First the hard grind and the acquiring of sufficient technical skill to make a living, the work at self-expression in spare time, and finally the complete emancipation from the daily job when recognition comes. This hard early training has given to Sloan a facility and a power of invention that the pure painter seldom achieves.”</p><p>Hopper, then, saw virtue in Sloan’s illustrations where he found only shame in his own—a double-standard modern scholars fortunately refuse to replicate. While most still view his <em>Adventure </em>illustrations as aberrational, few deny that his work for less sensational publications like <em>Hotel Management</em>, <em>Tavern Topics</em>, and the <em>Wells Fargo Messenger </em>allowed him to indulge and refine his chief curiosities. There, he captured women perched before sewing machines, families dining in Chinese restaurants, sailboats struggling in the wind. To Levin, this thematic sinew without question affixes Hopper’s illustrations to his greater oeuvre despite any late-in-life self-abnegation.</p><p>“What he was not so willing to admit was that in his work as an illustrator there are glimpses of the direction his art would take in the future,” she wrote. “The embryonic Hopper who would become one of America’s most outstanding realists is present in the illustrations even though he resisted total involvement in them.”</p><span></span></span><div><i></i><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/adventure-magazine/\" rel=\"tag\">Adventure Magazine</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/art/\" rel=\"tag\">art</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/art-critics/\" rel=\"tag\">art critics</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/artists/\" rel=\"tag\">artists</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/daniel-crown/\" rel=\"tag\">Daniel Crown</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/edward-hopper/\" rel=\"tag\">Edward Hopper</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/everybodys-magazine/\" rel=\"tag\">Everybody's Magazine</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/illustration/\" rel=\"tag\">illustration</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/illustrators/\" rel=\"tag\">illustrators</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/pulp-fiction/\" rel=\"tag\">pulp fiction</a><a href=\"https://lithub.com/tag/pulp-magazines/\" rel=\"tag\">pulp magazines</a></div><br/><hr/><div><span>Share:</span><div><div><ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F&t=The%20Unlikely%20Pulp%20Fiction%20Illustrations%20of%20Edward%20Hopper\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span>Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=lithub&text=The%20Unlikely%20Pulp%20Fiction%20Illustrations%20of%20Edward%20Hopper&url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F\" title=\"Click to share on Google+\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a href=\"#\"><span>More</span></a></li><li></li></ul><div><div><ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?token=&isFramed=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F\" title=\"Click to share on LinkedIn\"><span></span><span>Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F&title=The%20Unlikely%20Pulp%20Fiction%20Illustrations%20of%20Edward%20Hopper\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F&t=The%20Unlikely%20Pulp%20Fiction%20Illustrations%20of%20Edward%20Hopper\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://getpocket.com/save/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flithub.com%2Fthe-unlikely-pulp-fiction-illustrations-of-edward-hopper%2F&title=The%20Unlikely%20Pulp%20Fiction%20Illustrations%20of%20Edward%20Hopper\" title=\"Click to share on Pocket\"><span></span><span>Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br/><div><div><div id=\"about_the_author\"><div><a href=\"https://lithub.com/author/daniel-crown/\"><img src=\"https://lithub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-10-at-10.09.27-AM.png\" alt=\"Daniel Crown\"/></a></div><div> Daniel Crown is a freelance journalist based in New York City.

However, getting there may expose a bunch of problems in the infrastructure. This story is about one of them in particular. It's one of those things you might encounter when you finally get around to switching on IPv6 and discover that your vendor hasn't quite gotten the bugs out.</p><p>Let's say you build racks of 40 machines, and you spot one in a given rack that is being wonky. It's showing up on your monitoring as having elevated error counts as compared to its neighbors, or that latency is higher than others for whatever it does. You're not quite sure what to make of it as first, so you log into take a look.</p><p>The machine itself seems fine. It has no more CPU load than its friends, it's using about the same amount of memory, the hard drive is loaded about the same, and all of the usual on-host metrics seem good enough. You start noticing the problem by paying attention to the actual ssh you've done to poke at the machine.</p><p>Instead of a session that's nice and smooth with consistent latency (whatever it may be, based on distance to the box), the latency swings around all over the place. You start picking up on this, and once you start looking for it, it's no longer something you can ignore.</p><p>To be sure, you hold down a key and let it repeat. The machine echoes it back at the shell, and that's when it's crystal clear: instead of a steady stream of dots (or whatever), it comes in fits and starts. It'll block for a few seconds, then unleash a burst at you. It's annoying.</p><p>Meanwhile, a ssh to another box in the same rack seems super smooth and is great. You can't make it do the lag/burst thing no matter what. It echoes characters back with the same delay every time. There is no jitter.</p><p>Around this point, maybe you try to ping the bad box and a good box. They look exactly the same. This seems confusing at first, but then maybe someone points out that the ssh is over IPv6, or maybe you notice it yourself while looking at 'ss' or 'netstat'. Either way, this gets you thinking in terms of v4 vs. v6.</p><p>You switch to ping6. The round trip times don't seem consistent any more, but for the most part, they aren't too bad into the bad box. They're just a little strange: somewhat higher at times, much higher at others, and with just a touch of packet loss.</p><p>Clearly, this box is failing to do IPv6 properly, right? Well, not so fast. You have to measure from other angles, and so you do. You're already on another box in the same rack, and so you ping from the good one into the bad one. It's fine, as expected. You ping6 from the good one into the bad one, and it's <em>also fine</em>.</p><p>You repeat this with other tools to verify, and eventually it shakes down to this: traffic is slow to this one box, but only when it's coming in from outside the rack, and only when it's IPv6. If it's IPv4, it's always okay, and if it's from another host on the same switch (as its rackmates will be), it's always OK, whether v4 or v6.</p><p>Hopefully by now you have a little matrix down on a scratch sheet of paper or at least somewhere in your head. The patterns of \"good this way\" and \"bad that way\" should start adding up. Let's review.</p><p>If there was lagginess and general strangeness going into the box for both v4 and v6 traffic from any source, you might blame something specific to it. It could be something electrical, like a bad patch cable or fiber drop. It could be a bad NIC somehow. (We'll assume the software is identical since the machines are all under version control.)</p><p>If only v6 is slow from any source, then you might again blame some aspect of the machine. Maybe the offloading stuff on the NIC is broken. It's not as likely, but hey, what else do you have to work with here?</p><p>But no, this is only v6 being slow, and then only from outside the rack. This tells us that it can't reasonably be the NIC or the cable between it and the switch since the traffic manages to transit them just fine in other scenarios. Somehow, it's something about the traffic coming across the routing part of the switch on its way from the rest of the network. How does it \"know\" to be slow when it's coming from outside?</p><p>What could break v6 across the routing fabric?</p><p>Finally, you start up a ping6 and just let it keep plinking away at the bad box. It's wiggly, but the latency stays under 10 msec. While it's running, you fire up <em>another</em> ping6, but this one you set for 9000 byte packets and add the \"flood ping\" option for good measure. You let it rip.</p><p>As soon as the second ping6 kicks off, the first one sees its latency shoot way up, and then it starts dropping packets. The second ping6 starts spraying dots at you as it detects packet loss, too. Your ssh over IPv6 to the box gets completely disgusting, with huge delays.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, your ssh over IPv4 to the same box is just fine, as is plain old ping. Also, your ssh over IPv6 coming from the neighboring box is just fine, too!</p><p>Just what is going on here?</p><p>At this point in the story when it happened to me, I concluded the rack switch's routing part was seriously broken. It was somehow unable to route packets to this one IPv6 destination in any quantity. If you sent it enough, like with the flood ping, or during normal operations, it would just fall over.</p><p>In real life, I dragged someone from the network side of things to look at it, and they proudly concluded that the pings were fine. The fact that at network-idle, a good box had a consistent 0.1 msec and the bad box was yielding jittery results of anywhere from 1.0 to 10 msec. \"1 msec is fine\" (or somesuch) was their argument, completely missing my point.</p><p>At this point when it happened for real, I was now good and pissed off at having spent all this effort to find a real problem, only to have it dismissed as \"no big deal\". I decided to run a scan of the entire brand new environment to look for other hosts which were also having these problems.</p><p>That night, I \"rage coded\" something really dirty that would start up a ping6 to get a baseline, then it would start the antagonist (huge flood pings) and would measure again. If it looked substantially different, it flagged the host for manual review. I let it run on the whole environment and found a non-trivial number of single-host-per-rack anomalies all over the place.</p><p>Given that it was hosed and nobody was taking me seriously, I just pulled the plug on the whole (brand new) environment. It had only just gone online that evening, and could stay offline another day or two until someone actually figured out what was going on.</p><p>That is exactly what happened. I sat on that disable from Thursday until Tuesday when someone finally cracked the problem. It took a lot of escalating and poking of manager types to get a fresh set of eyes on the problem who would not discount me out of hand.</p><p>That's when they noticed something I could not see from my vantage point as end-user on the network: the routers, for some reason, did not have an entry in their forwarding tables for the IPv6 addresses for the slowpoke hosts. Every other host on a rack would be there as you would expect, but for some reason a couple of them would get corrupted or otherwise would disappear.</p><p>As they explained to me later, when this happened, the usual \"fast path\" forwarding through the router broke down. It would have to look at the packet with the general-purpose CPU on the switch, which would then figure out where to send it, and the packet would go on its way. Trouble is, there's no way that path could handle line speed routing of these packets. It was supposed to populate the forwarding table at which point the ASICs would handle it on the fast path, but that never happened.</p><p>When we sent enough traffic, the CPU simply couldn't keep up, and the packets would be dropped. This would happen naturally as the machines received normal traffic, and so it introduced our problem.</p><p>Short term, the solution was to poke the switches and flush the forwarding tables used by the ASICs. This got them to re-establish everything, including the one for the trouble spots. They all went back to operating at line speed for all traffic, inside and out.</p><p>The next step was to set something up to keep tabs on the syslog on these routing switches. Apparently, when the forwarding table had this issue, it would emit some kind of warning in the log. By watching for it, you could automate a flush of the cache to get things going again. </p><p>This was majorly crappy, but it did get the environment back on its feet, and it was able to be re-enabled after several days sitting there doing exactly nothing (and wasting tons of money, no doubt).</p><p>The long term solution did involve yelling at the vendor and getting them to fix their corruption issue.</p><p>Lessons learned:</p><p>Pay attention to ssh lag, even if it seems minor, particularly if it's only jittery and only to the bad box and not to the others.</p><p>Think through the paths involved for the traffic. If some paths are slow and others are not, it's probably something to do with the paths and not the end device.</p><p>Find ways to try multiple paths to the same end device to prove out the last item. Otherwise, how can you be sure?</p><p>Don't accept the status quo when you report a problem and they blow you off. If you're sure it's there, don't doubt yourself. If you've practiced solid scientific methods and have a decent argument backed by data, stay on that thing until someone has to deal with you (and it).</p><p>Finally, when the last item stops working, and you start getting in trouble for it, leave the company behind.</p></div></div>","score":60,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521310483,"text":"I find it sad and amusing that turning every piece of equipment off and on again would have fixed the symptoms, i.e. flushed the caches.","parent":16606286,"id":16608240,"by":"nikanj"},{"type":"comment","time":1521318612,"text":"I was sure this was going to be an MTU issue.

A place where you — either by yourself or with a few friends — can broadcast to an audience. With a few friends, it reads like a conversation.<p>A few months ago, we wanted to create a music blog together. We started to look at our options for creating a music blog, and realized that there weren’t any good ones. We didn’t want to create our own website, because people would have to remember to visit our domain and wouldn’t get notified when we posted. We looked at other music blogs on the internet, but it seemed like most of them were dying or have already died. We wanted a place where we could both share and bounce music off each other, and have our friends subscribe. And we couldn’t find an easy way to do this. We realized that this same issue arises not just in music, but in many other areas.<p>So we created Rhythmm — a place where you can create a Slack-like channel that people can subscribe to. Do whatever you want with it.

Telegram channels definitely provided us inspiration for our product. We loved the idea of them, but thought that there were major holes in their product that have still not been fixed or addressed, and they created &quot;channels&quot; in 2015. Here are the problems we wanted to address:<p>1. Telegram broadcast channels only allow 1 contributor. We think that there are a lot of interesting use cases that arise when having multiple contributors on one broadcast.\n2. Telegram has absolutely no explore feature (other than searching and hoping for the best).\n3. Telegram is a chat app first and foremost. It doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re going to spend any time building new features specifically for broadcasts. We have lot of really exciting features that we&#x27;re currently working on that will continue to make our experience better different times of feedback.<p>Does that answer your question?","parent":16608595,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1521322374,"text":"Yes.

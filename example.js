It suffices for an intransigent minority –a certain type of intransigent minorities –to reach a minutely small level, say three or four percent of the total population, for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences. Further, an optical illusion comes with the dominance of the minority: a naive observer would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority. If it seems absurd, it is because our scientific intuitions aren’t calibrated for that (fughedabout scientific and academic intuitions and snap judgments; they don’t work and your standard intellectualization fails with complex systems, though not your grandmothers’ wisdom).</p><p id=\"eb55\">The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in way not predicted by the components. The interactions matter more than the nature of the units. Studying individual ants will <em>never</em> (one can safely say never for most such situations), never give us an idea on how the ant colony operates. For that, one needs to understand an ant colony as an ant colony, no less, no more, not a collection of ants. This is called an “emergent” property of the whole, by which <em>parts</em> and <em>whole</em> differ because what matters is the interactions between such parts. And interactions can obey very simple rules. The rule we discuss in this chapter is the <em>minority</em> rule.</p><p id=\"9962\">The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.</p><figure id=\"619d\"><div></div></figure><p id=\"9667\">This example of complexity hit me, ironically, as I was attending the New England Complex Systems institute summer barbecue. As the hosts were setting up the table and unpacking the drinks, a friend who was observant and only ate Kosher dropped by to say hello. I offered him a glass of that type of yellow sugared water with citric acid people sometimes call lemonade, almost certain that he would reject it owing to his dietary laws. He didn’t. He drank the liquid called lemonade, and another Kosher person commented: “liquids around here are Kosher”. We looked at the carton container. There was a fine print: a tiny symbol, a <em>U</em> inside a circle, indicating that it was Kosher. The symbol will be detected by those who need to know and look for the minuscule print. As to others, like myself, I had been speaking prose all these years without knowing, drinking Kosher liquids without knowing they were Kosher liquids.</p><figure id=\"40a8\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*kB_cWkC195GVsgK-Kuym_Q.png\"/></div><figcaption>Figure 1 The lemonade container with the circled U indicating it is (literally) Kosher.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"23c3\">Criminals With Peanut Allergies</h3><p id=\"9dbd\">A strange idea hit me. The Kosher population represents less than three tenth of a percent of the residents of the United States. Yet, it appears that almost all drinks are Kosher. Why? Simply because going full Kosher allows the producer, grocer, restaurant, to not have to distinguish between Kosher and nonkosher for liquids, with special markers, separate aisles, separate inventories, different stocking sub-facilities. And the simple rule that changes the total is as follows:</p><p id=\"c9ef\"><em>A Kosher (or halal) eater will never eat nonkosher (or nonhalal) food , but a nonkosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher.</em></p><p id=\"8ca6\">Or, rephrased in another domain:</p><p id=\"bd10\"><em>A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom but a nondisabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people.</em></p><p id=\"5831\">Granted, sometimes, in practice, we hesitate to use the bathroom with the disabled sign on it owing to some confusion –mistaking the rule for the one for parking cars, under the belief that the bathroom is reserved for exclusive use by the handicapped.</p><p id=\"da32\"><em>Someone with a peanut allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts but a person without such allergy can eat items without peanut traces in them.</em></p><p id=\"72bf\">Which explains why it is so hard to find peanuts on airplanes and why schools are peanut-free (which, in a way, increases the number of persons with peanut allergies as reduced exposure is one of the causes behind such allergies).</p><p id=\"4910\">Let us apply the rule to domains where it can get entertaining:</p><p id=\"6fd0\"><em>An honest person will never commit criminal acts but a criminal will readily engage in legal acts.</em></p><p id=\"d8c4\">Let us call such minority an <em>intransigent</em> group, and the majority a <em>flexible</em> one. And the rule is an asymmetry in choices.</p><p id=\"f43f\">I once pulled a prank on a friend. Years ago when Big Tobacco were hiding and repressing the evidence of harm from secondary smoking, New York had smoking and nonsmoking sections in restaurants (even airplanes had, absurdly, a smoking section). I once went to lunch with a friend visiting from Europe: the restaurant only had availability in the smoking sections. I convinced the friend that we needed to buy cigarettes as we <em>had to</em> smoke in the smoking section. He complied.</p><p id=\"b022\">Two more things. First, the geography of the terrain, that is, the spatial structure, matters a bit; it makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own district or are mixed with the rest of the population. If the people following the minority rule lived in Ghettos, with their separate small economy, then the minority rule would not apply. But, when a population has an even spatial distribution, say the ratio of such a minority in a neighborhood is the same as that in the village, that in the village is the same as in the county, that in the county is the same as that in state, and that in the sate is the same as nationwide, then the (flexible) majority will have to submit to the minority rule. Second, the cost structure matters quite a bit. It happens in our first example that making lemonade compliant with Kosher laws doesn’t change the price by much, not enough to justify inventories. But if the manufacturing of Kosher lemonade cost substantially more, then the rule will be weakened in some nonlinear proportion to the difference in costs. If it cost ten times as much to make Kosher food, then the minority rule will not apply, except perhaps in some very rich neighborhoods.</p><p id=\"a210\">Muslims have Kosher laws so to speak, but these are much narrower and apply only to meat. For Muslim and Jews have near-identical slaughter rules (all Kosher is halal for most Sunni Muslims, or was so in past centuries, but the reverse is not true). Note that these slaughter rules are skin-in-the-game driven, inherited from the ancient Eastern Mediterranean [discussed in Chapter] Greek and Semitic practice to only worship the gods if one has skin in the game, sacrifice meat to the divinity, and eat what’s left. The Gods do not like cheap signaling.</p><p id=\"681f\">Now consider this manifestation of the dictatorship of the minority. In the United Kingdom, where the (practicing) Muslim population is only three to four percent, a very high number of the meat we find is halal. Close to seventy percent of lamb imports from New Zealand are halal. Close to ten percent of the chain Subway carry halal-only stores (meaning no pork), in spite of the high costs from the loss of business of nonpork stores. The same holds in South Africa where, with the same proportion of Muslims, a disproportionately higher number of chicken is Halal certified. But in the U.K. and other Christian countries, halal is not neutral enough to reach a high level, as people may rebel against forceful abidance to other’s religious norms. For instance, the 7th Century Christian Arab poet Al-Akhtal made a point to never eat halal meat, in his famous defiant poem boasting his Christianity: “I do not eat sacrificial flesh”. (Al-Akhtal was reflecting the standard Christian reaction from three or four centuries earlier — Christians were tortured in pagan times by being forced to eat sacrificial meat, which they found sacrilegious. Many Christian martyrs starved to death.)</p><p id=\"6cbc\">One can expect the same rejection of religious norms to take place in the West as the Muslim populations in Europe grows.</p><figure id=\"653d\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*IRS1M8CZj2yVLnU4IiaFUw.png\"/></div><figcaption>Figure 2 Renormalization group: steps one through three (start from the top): Four boxes containing four boxes, with one of the boxes pink at step one, with successive applications of the minority rule.</figcaption></figure><p id=\"2faf\">So the minority rule may produce a larger share of halal food in the stores than warranted by the proportion of halal eaters in the population, but with a headwind somewhere because some people may have a taboo against Moslem food. But with some non-religious Kashrut rules, so to speak, the share can be expected converge to closer to a hundred percent (or some high number). In the U.S. and Europe, “organic” food companies are selling more and more products precisely because of the minority rule and because ordinary and unlabeled food may be seen by some to contain pesticides, herbicides, and transgenic genetically modified organisms, “GMOs” with, according to them, unknown risks. (What we call GMOs in this context means transgenic food, entailing the transfer of genes from a foreign organism or species). Or it could be for some existential reasons, cautious behavior, or Burkean conservatism –some may not want to venture too far too fast from what their grandparents ate. Labeling something “organic” is a way to say that it contains no transgenic GMOs.</p><p id=\"7626\">In promoting genetically modified food via all manner of lobbying, purchasing of congressmen, and overt scientific propaganda (with smear campaigns against such persons as yours truly), the big agricultural companies foolishly believed that all they needed was to win the majority. No, you idiots. As I said, your snap “scientific” judgment is too naive in these type of decisions. Consider that transgenic-GMO eaters will eat nonGMOs, but not the reverse. So it may suffice to have a tiny, say no more than five percent of evenly spatially distributed population of non-genetically modified eaters for the <em>entire</em> population to have to eat non-GMO food. How? Say you have a corporate event, a wedding, or a lavish party to celebrate the fall of the Saudi Arabian regime, the bankruptcy of the rent-seeking investment bank Goldman Sachs, or the public reviling of Ray Kotcher, chairman of Ketchum the public relation firm that smears scientists and scientific whistleblowers on behalf of big corporations. Do you need to send a questionnaire asking people if they eat or don’t eat transgenic GMOs and reserve special meals accordingly? No. You just select everything non-GMO, provided the price difference is not consequential. And the price difference appears to be small enough to be negligible as (perishable) food costs in America are largely, about up to eighty or ninety percent, determined by distribution and storage, not the cost at the agricultural level. And as organic food (and designations such as “natural”) is in higher demand, from the minority rule, distribution costs decrease and the minority rule ends up accelerating in its effect.</p><p id=\"e9f5\">Big Ag (the large agricultural firms) did not realize that this is the equivalent of entering a game in which one needed to not just win more points than the adversary, but win ninety-seven percent of the total points just to be safe. It is strange, once again, to see Big Ag who spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research cum smear campaigns, with hundreds of these scientists who think of themselves as more intelligent than the rest of the population, miss such an elementary point about asymmetric choices.</p><p id=\"2bab\">Another example: do not think that the spread of automatic shifting cars is necessarily due to the majority of drivers initially preferring automatic; it can just be because those who can drive manual shifts can always drive automatic, but the reciprocal is not true <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>.</p><p id=\"342b\">The method of analysis employed here is called renormalization group, a powerful apparatus in mathematical physics that allows us to see how things scale up (or down). Let us examine it next –without mathematics.</p><h3 id=\"efe4\">Renormalization Group</h3><p id=\"b5b1\">Figure 2 shows four boxes exhibiting what is called fractal self-similarity. Each box contains four smaller boxes. Each one of the four boxes will contain four boxes, and so all the way down, and all the way up until we reach a certain level. There are two colors: yellow for the majority choice, and pink for the minority one.</p><p id=\"ca6e\">Assume the smaller unit contains four people, a family of four. One of them is in the intransigent minority and eats only nonGMO food (which includes organic). The color of the box is pink and the others yellow . We “renormalize once” as we move up: the stubborn daughter manages to impose her rule on the four and the unit is now all pink, i.e. will opt for nonGMO. Now, step three, you have the family going to a barbecue party attended by three other families. As they are known to only eat nonGMO, the guests will cook only organic. The local grocery store realizing the neighborhood is only nonGMO switches to nonGMO to simplify life, which impacts the local wholesaler, and the stories continues and “renormalizes”.</p><p id=\"5d07\">By some coincidence, the day before the Boston barbecue, I was flaneuring in New York, and I dropped by the office of a friend I wanted to prevent from working, that is, engage in an activity that when abused, causes the loss of mental clarity, in addition to bad posture and loss of definition in the facial features. The French physicist Serge Galam happened to be visiting and chose the friend’s office to kill time. Galam was first to apply these renormalization techniques to social matters and political science; his name was familiar as he is the author of the main book on the subject, which had then been sitting for months in an unopened Amazon box in my basement. He introduced me to his research and showed me a computer model of elections by which it suffices that some minority exceeds a certain level for its choices to prevail.</p><p id=\"9950\">So the same illusion exists in political discussions, spread by the political “scientists”: you think that because some extreme right or left wing party has, say, the support of ten percent of the population that their candidate would get ten percent of the votes. No: these baseline voters should be classified as “inflexible” and will always vote for their faction. But some of the flexible voters <em>can</em> also vote for that extreme faction, just as nonKosher people can eat Kosher, and these people are the ones to watch out for as they may swell the numbers of votes for the extreme party. Galam’s models produced a bevy of counterintuitive effects in political science –and his predictions turned out to be way closer to real outcomes than the naive consensus.</p><h3 id=\"6f03\">The Veto</h3><p id=\"0078\">The fact we saw from the renormalization group the “veto” effect as a person in a group can steer choices. Rory Sutherland suggested that this explains why some fast-food chains, such as McDonald thrive, not because they offer a great product, but because they are not vetoed in a certain socio-economic group –and by a small proportions of people in that group at that. To put it in technical terms, it was a best worse-case divergence from expectations: a lower variance and lower mean.</p><p id=\"df3d\">When there are few choices, McDonald’s appears to be a safe bet. It is also a safe bet in shady places with few regulars where the food variance from expectation can be consequential –I am writing these lines in Milan’s cental train station and as offensive as it can be to a visitor from far away, McDonald’s is one of the few restaurants there. Shockingly, one sees Italians there seeking refuge from a risky meal.</p><p id=\"36d8\">Pizza is the same story: it is commonly accepted food and outside a fancy party nobody will be blamed for ordering it.</p><p id=\"abbc\">Rory wrote to me about the asymmetry beer-wine and the choices made for parties: “Once you have ten percent or more women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need one set of glasses if you serve only wine — the universal donor, to use the language of blood groups.”</p><p id=\"b309\">This strategy of the best lower bound might have been played by the Khazars looking to chose between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Legend has it that three high ranking delegations (bishops, rabbis and sheikhs) came to make the sales pitch. They asked the Christians: if you were forced to chose between Judaism and Islam, which one would you pick? Judaism, they replied. Then they asked the Muslim: which of the two, Christianity or Judaism. Judaism, the Muslim said. Judaim it was and the tribe converted.</p><h3 id=\"4c66\">Lingua Franca</h3><p id=\"9fef\">If a meeting is taking place in Germany in the Teutonic-looking conference room of a corporation that is sufficiently international or European, and one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run in… English, the brand of inelegant English used in corporations across the world. That way they can equally offend their Teuronic ancestors and the English language<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a>. It all started with the asymmetric rule that those who are nonnative in English know (bad) English, but the reverse (English speakers knowing other languages) is less likely. French was supposed to be the language of diplomacy as civil servants coming from aristocratic background used it –while their more vulgar compatriots involved in commerce relied on English. In the rivalry between the two languages, English won as commerce grew to dominate modern life; the victory it has nothing to do with the prestige of France or the efforts of their civil servants in promoting their more or less beautiful Latinized and logically spelled language over the orthographically confusing one of trans-Channel meat-pie eaters.</p><p id=\"79ec\">We can thus get some intuition on how the emergence of <em>lingua franca</em> languages can come from minority rules–and that is a point that is not visible to linguists. Aramaic is a Semitic language which succeeded Canaanite (that is, Phoenician-Hebrew) in the Levant and resembles Arabic; it was the language Jesus Christ spoke. The reason it came to dominate the Levant and Egypt isn’t because of any particular imperial Semitic power or the fact that they have interesting noses. It was the Persians –who speak an Indo-European language –who spread Aramaic, the language of Assyria, Syria, and Babylon. Persians taught Egyptians a language that was not their own. Simply, when the Persians invaded Babylon they found an administration with scribes who could only use Aramaic and didn’t know Persian, so Aramaic became the state language. If your secretary can only take dictation in Aramaic, Aramaic is what you will use. This led to the oddity of Aramaic being used in Mongolia, as records were maintained in the Syriac alphabet (Syriac is the Eastern dialect of Aramaic). And centuries later, the story would repeat itself in reverse, with the Arabs using Greek in their early administration in the seventh and eighth’s centuries. For during the Hellenistic era, Greek replaced Aramaic as the <em>lingua franca</em> in the Levant, and the scribes of Damascus maintained their records in Greek. But it was not the Greeks who spread Greek around the Mediterranean –Alexander (himself not Greek but Macedonian and spoke a different dialect of Greek) did not lead to an immediate deep cultural Hellenization. It was the Romans who accelerated the spreading of Greek, as they used it in their administration across the Eastern empire.</p><p id=\"1acf\">A French Canadian friend from Montreal, Jean-Louis Rheault, commented as follows, bemoaning the loss of language of French Canadians outside narrowly provincial areas. He said: “In Canada, when we say bilingual, it is English speaking and when we say “French speaking” it becomes bilingual.”</p><h3 id=\"756b\">Decentralize, Again</h3><p id=\"9f0b\">Another attribute of decentralization, and one that the “intellectuals” opposing an exit of Britain from the European Union (Brexit ) don’t get. If one needs, say a three pct. threshold in a political unit for the minority rule to take its effect, and <em>on average</em> the stubborn minority represents three pct. of the population, with variations around the average, then some states will be subject to the rule, but not others. If on the other hand we merged all states in one, then the minority rule will prevail all across. This is the reason the U.S.A. works so well as, I have been repeating to everyone who listens, we are a federation, not a republic. To use the language of <em>Antifragile</em>, decentralization is <em>convex</em> to variations.</p><h3 id=\"bcd1\">Genes vs Languages</h3><p id=\"0bcd\">Looking at genetic data in the Eastern Mediterranean with my collaborator the geneticist Pierre Zalloua, we noticed that both invaders, Turks and Arabs left little genes and in the case of Turkey, the tribes from East and Central Asia brought an entirely new language. Turkey, shockingly, still has the populations of Asia Minor you read about in history books, but with new names. Further, Zalloua and his colleagues have shown that Canaanites from 3700 years ago represent more than nine tenth of the genes of current residents of the state of Lebanon, with only a tiny amount of new genes added, in spite of about every possible army having dropped by for sightseeing and some pillaging.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> While Turks are Mediterraneans who speak an East Asian language, the French (North of Avignon) are largely of Northern European stock, yet they speak a Mediterranean language.</p><p id=\"8208\">So:</p><p id=\"b4dd\"><em>Genes follow majority rules; languages minority rule</em></p><p id=\"939b\"><em>Languages travel; genes less so</em></p><p id=\"9dd2\">This shows us the recent mistake to build racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites”, based on linguistic considerations. While the subject was central to the German Nazis, the practice continues today in one form or another, often benign. For the great irony is that Nordic supremacists (“Aryan”), while anti-Semitic, used the classical Greeks to give themselves a pedigree and a link to a glorious civilization, but didn’t realize that the Greeks and their Mediterranean “Semitic” neighbors were actually genetically close to one another. It has been recently shown that both ancient Greeks and Bronze age Levantines share an Anatolian origin. It just happened that the languages diverged.</p><p id=\"c214\"><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> There is a current controversy in the U.K. as the Normand left more texts and pictures in history books than genes there.</p><h3 id=\"09fe\">The One-Way Street of Religions</h3><p id=\"83a5\">In the same manner, the spread of Islam in the Near East where Christianity was heavily entrenched (it was born there) can be attributed to two simple asymmetries. The original Islamic rulers weren’t particularly interested in converting Christians as these provided them with tax revenues –the proselytism of Islam did not address those called “people of the book”, i.e. individuals of Abrahamic faith. In fact, my ancestors who survived thirteen centuries under Muslim rule saw advantages in not being Muslim: mostly in the avoidance of military conscription.</p><p id=\"34ea\">The two asymmetric rules were are as follows. First, if a non Muslim man under the rule of Islam marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam –and if <em>either</em> parents of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a>. Second, becoming Muslim is irreversible, as apostasy is the heaviest crime under the religion, sanctioned by the death penalty. The famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, born Mikhael Demetri Shalhoub, was of Lebanese Christian origins. He converted to Islam to marry a famous Egyptian actress and had to change his name to an Arabic one. He later divorced, but did not revert to the faith of his ancestors.</p><p id=\"4f89\">Under these two asymmetric rules, one can do simple simulations and see how a small Islamic group occupying Christian (Coptic) Egypt can lead, over the centuries, to the Copts becoming a tiny minority. All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages. Likewise, one can see how Judaism doesn’t spread and tends to stay in the minority, as the religion has opposite rules: the mother is required to be Jewish, causing interfaith marriages to leave the community. An even stronger asymmetry than that of Judaism explains the depletion in the Near East of three Gnostic faiths: the Druze, the Ezidi, and the Mandeans (Gnostic religions are those with <em>mysteries</em> and <em>knowledge</em> that is typically accessible to only a minority of elders, with the rest of the members in the dark about the details of the faith). Unlike Islam that requires either parents to be Muslim, and Judaism that asks for at least the mother to have the faith, these three religions require <em>both</em> parents to be of the faith, otherwise the person says <em>toodaloo</em> to the community.</p><p id=\"a21a\">Egypt has a flat terrain. The distribution of the population presents homogeneous mixtures there, which permits renormalization (i.e. allows the asymmetric rule to prevail) –we saw earlier in the chapter that for Kosher rules to work, one needed Jews to be somewhat spread out across the country. But in places such as Lebanon, Galilee, and Northern Syria, with mountainous terrain, Christians and other Non Sunni Muslims remained concentrated. Christians not being exposed to Muslims, experienced no intermarriage.</p><p id=\"b39f\">Egypt’s Copts suffered from another problem: the irreversibility of Islamic conversions. Many Copts during Islamic rule converted to Islam when it was merely an administrative procedure, something that helps one land a job or handle a problem that requires Islamic jurisprudence. One do not have to really believe in it since Islam doesn’t conflict markedly with Orthodox Christianity. Little by little a Christian or Jewish family bearing the marrano-style conversion becomes truly converted, as, a couple of generations later, the descendants forget the arrangement of their ancestors.</p><p id=\"7e05\">So all Islam did was out-stubborn Christianity, which itself won thanks to its own stubbornness. For, before Islam, the original spread of Christianity in the Roman empire can be largely seen due to… the blinding intolerance of Christians, their unconditional, aggressive and proselyting recalcitrance. Roman pagans were initially tolerant of Christians, as the tradition was to share gods with other members of the empire. But they wondered why these Nazarenes didn’t want to give and take gods and offer that Jesus fellow to the Roman pantheon in exchange for some other gods. What, our gods aren’t good enough for them? But Christians were intolerant of Roman paganism. The “persecutions” of the Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon and local gods, than the reverse. What we read is history written by the Christian side, not the Greco-Roman one. <a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a></p><p id=\"e88a\">We know too little about the Roman side during the rise of Christianity, as hagiographies have dominated the discourse: we have for instance the narrative of the martyr Saint Catherine, who kept converting her jailors until she was beheaded, except that… she may have never existed. There are endless histories of Christian martyrs and saints –but very little about the other side, Pagan heroes. All we have is the bit we know about the reversion to Christianity during the emperor Julian’s apostasy and the writings of his entourage of Syrian-Greek pagans such as Libanius Antiochus. Julian had tried to go back to Ancient Paganism in vain: it was like trying to keep a balloon under water. And it was not because the majority was pagan as historians mistakenly think: it was because the Christian side was too unyielding. Christianity had great minds such as Gregorius of Nazianzen and Basil of Caesaria, but nothing to match the great orator Libanius, not even close. (My heuristic is that the more pagan, the more brilliant one’s mind, and the higher one’s ability to handle nuances and ambiguity. Purely monotheistic religious such as Protestant Christianity, Salafi Islam, or fundamentalist atheism accommodate literalist and mediocre minds that cannot handle ambiguity.)</p><p id=\"62f8\">In fact we can observe in the history of Mediterranean “religions” or, rather, rituals and systems of behavior and belief, a drift dictated by the intolerant, actually bringing the system closer to what we can call a religion. Judaism might have almost lost because of the mother-rule and the confinement to a tribal base, but Christianity ruled, and for the very same reasons, Islam did. Islam? there have been many <em>Islams</em>, the final accretion quite different from the earlier ones. For Islam itself is ending up being taken over (in the Sunni branch) by the purists simply because these were more intolerant than the rest: the Wahhabis, founders of Saudi Arabia, were the ones who destroyed the shrines, and to impose the maximally intolerant rule, in a manner that was later imitated by “ISIS” (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant). Every single accretion of Sunni Islam seems to be there to accommodate the most intolerant of its branches.</p><h3 id=\"89d1\">Imposing Virtue on Others</h3><p id=\"ab4e\">This idea of one-sidedness can help us debunk a few more misconceptions. How do books get banned? Certainly not because they offend the average person –most persons are passive and don’t really care, or don’t care enough to request the banning. It looks like, from past episodes, that all it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the black-listing of some people. The great philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell lost his job at the City University of New York owing to a letter by an angry –and stubborn –mother who did not wish to have her daughter in the same room as the fellow with dissolute lifestyle and unruly ideas. <a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a></p><p id=\"325f\">The same seems to apply to prohibitions –at least the prohibition of alcohol in the United States which led to interesting Mafia stories.</p><p id=\"16e6\">Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights.</p><p id=\"f7af\">An insight as to how the mechanisms of religion and transmission of morals obey the same renormalization dynamics as dietary laws –and how we can show that morality is more likely to be something enforced by a minority. We saw earlier in the chapter the asymmetry between obeying and breaking rules: a law-abiding (or rule abiding) fellow always follows the rules, but a felon or someone with looser sets of principles will not <em>always</em> break the rules. Likewise we discussed the strong asymmetric effects of the <em>halal</em> dietary laws. Let us merge the two. It turns out that, in classical Arabic, the term <em>halal</em> has one opposite: <em>haram</em>. Violating legal and moral rules –any rule — is called <em>haram</em>. It is the exact same interdict that governs food intake and <em>all</em> other human behaviors, like sleeping with the wife of the neighbor, lending with interest (without partaking of downside of the borrower) or killing one’s landlord for pleasure. <em>Haram</em> is <em>haram</em> and is asymmetric.</p><p id=\"e09e\">From that we can see that once a moral rule is established, it would suffice to have a small intransigent minority of geographically distributed followers to dictate the norm in society. The sad news, as we will see in the next chapter, is that one person looking at mankind as an aggregate may mistakenly believe that humans are spontaneously becoming more moral, better, more gentle, have better breath, when it applies to only a small proportion of mankind.</p><h4 id=\"7a9a\">The Stability of the Minority Rule, A Probabilistic Argument</h4><p id=\"d6f2\">A probabilistic argument in favor of the minority rule dictating societal values is as follows. Wherever you look across societies and histories, you tend to find the same general moral laws prevailing, with some, but not significant, variations: <em>do not steal</em> (at least not from within the tribe); <em>do not hunt orphans for pleasure; do not gratuitously beat up passers by for training, use instead a boxing bags </em>(unless you are Spartan and even then you can only kill a limited number of helots for training purposes)<em>, </em>and similar interdicts. And we can see these rules evolving over time to become more universal, expanding to a broader set, to progressively include slaves, other tribes, other species (animals, economists), etc. And one property of these laws: they are black-and-white, binary, discrete, and allow no shadow. You cannot steal “a little bit” or murder “moderately”. You cannot keep Kosher and eat “just a little bit” of pork on Sunday barbecues.</p><p id=\"845d\">Now it would be vastly more likely that these values emerged from a minority that the majority. Why? Take the following two theses:</p><p id=\"6fe2\"><em>Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule — the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to be emerge independently across populations.</em></p><p id=\"4b4a\"><em>What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be be black-and-white.</em></p><p id=\"52bf\">An example. Consider that an evil person wants to poison the collective by putting some product into soda cans. He has two options. The first is cyanide, which obeys a minority rule: a drop of poison (higher than a small threshold) makes the entire liquid poisonous. The second is a “majority”-style poison; it requires more than half the liquid to be poisonous in order to kill. Now look at the inverse problem, a collection of dead people after a dinner party, and you need to investigate the cause. The local Sherlock Holmes would assert that conditional on the outcome that <em>all people drinking the soda having been killed</em>, the evil man opted for the first not the second option. Simply, the majority rule leads to fluctuations around the average, with a high rate of survival.</p><p id=\"bbd5\">The black-and-white character of these societal laws can be explained with the following. Assume that under a certain regime, when you mix white and dark blue in various combinations, you don’t get variations of light blue, but dark blue. Such a regime is vastly more likely to produce dark blue than another rule that allows more shades of blue.</p><h3 id=\"9ffb\">Popper’s Paradox</h3><p id=\"0599\"><strong>I was at a large multi-table dinner party, the kind of situation where you have to choose between the vegetarian risotto and the non-vegetarian option when I noticed that my neighbor had his food catered (including silverware) on a tray reminiscent of airplane fare. The dishes were sealed with aluminum foil. He was evidently ultra-Kosher. It did not bother him to be seated with prosciutto eaters who, in addition, mix butter and meat in the same dishes. He just wanted to be left alone to follow his own preferences.</strong></p><p id=\"ac5a\"><strong>For Jews and Muslim minorities such as Shiites, Sufis, and associated religions such as Druze and Alawis, the aim is for people to leave them alone so they can satisfy their own dietary preferences –largely, with historical exceptions here and there. But had my neighbor been a Sunni Salafi, he would have required the entire room to be eating Halal. Perhaps the entire building. Perhaps the entire town. Hopefully the entire country. Hopefully the entire planet. Indeed, given the total lack of separation between church and state, and between the holy and the profane (Chapter x), to him Haram (the opposite of Halal) means literally illegal. The entire room was committing a legal violation.</strong></p><p id=\"e5d6\">As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight fundamentalists.As I am writing these lines, people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight Salafi fundamentalists.</p><p id=\"6ce3\">Clearly can democracy –by definition the majority — tolerate enemies? The question is as follows: “ Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?” Let’s go one step further, “Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?”</p><p id=\"436c\">This is in fact the incoherence that Kurt Gödel (the grandmaster of logical rigor) detected in the constitution while taking the naturalization exam. Legend has it that Gödel started arguing with the judge and Einstein, who was his witness during the process, saved him.</p><p id=\"5bce\">I wrote about people with logical flaws asking me if one should be “skeptical about skepticism”; I used a similar answer as Popper when was asked if “ one could falsify falsification”.</p><p id=\"d0c7\">We can answer these points using the minority rule. Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, as we saw, it <em>will</em> eventually destroy our world.</p><p id=\"15bf\">So, we need to be more than intolerant with <em>some</em> intolerant minorities. It is not permissible to use “American values” or “Western principles” in treating intolerant Salafism (which denies other peoples’ right to have their own religion). The West is currently in the process of committing suicide.</p><h3 id=\"7072\">The Irreverence of Markets and Science</h3><p id=\"3ace\">Now consider markets. We can say that markets aren’t the sum of market participants, but price changes reflect the activities of the most <em>motivated</em> buyer and seller. Yes, the most motivated rules. Indeed this is something that only traders seem to understand: why a price can drop by ten percent because of a single seller. All you need is a stubborn seller. Markets react in a way that is disproportional to the impetus. The overall stock markets represent currently more than thirty trillions dollars but a single order in 2008, only fifty billion, that is less than two tenth of a percent of the total, caused them to drop by close to ten percent, causing losses of around three trillion. It was an order activated by the Parisian Bank Société Générale who discovered a hidden acquisition by a rogue trader and wanted to reverse the purchase. Why did the market react so disproportionately? Because the order was one-way –stubborn — there was desire to sell but no way to change one’s mind. My personal adage is:</p><p id=\"3f29\"><em>The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door.</em></p><p id=\"8115\">And the best way to detect a sucker (say the usual finance journalist) is to see if his focus is on the size of the door or on that of the theater. Stampedes happen in cinemas, say when someone shouts “fire”, because those who want to be out do not want to stay in, exactly the same unconditionality we saw with Kosher observance.</p><p id=\"41b0\">Science acts similarly.<em></em>We will return later with a discussion of how the minority rule is behind Karl Popper’s approach to science. But let us for now discuss the more entertaining Feynman. <em>What do You Care What Other People Think?</em> is the title of a book of anecdotes by the great Richard Feynman, the most irreverent and playful scientist of his day. As reflected in the title of the book, Feynman conveys in it the idea of the fundamental irreverence of science, acting through a similar mechanism as the Kosher asymmetry. How? Science isn’t the sum of what scientists think, but exactly as with markets, a procedure that is highly skewed. Once you debunk something, it is now wrong (that is how science operates but let’s ignore disciplines such as economics and political science that are more like pompous entertainment). Had science operated by majority consensus we would be still stuck in the Middle Ages and Einstein would have ended as he started, a patent clerk with fruitless side hobbies.</p><p id=\"77db\">***</p><p id=\"ceea\">Alexander said that it was preferable to have an army of sheep led by a lion to an army of lions led by a sheep. Alexander (or no doubt he who produced this probably apocryphal saying) understood the value of the active, intolerant, and courageous minority. Hannibal terrorized Rome for a decade and a half with a tiny army of mercenaries, winning twenty-two battles against the Romans, battles in which he was outnumbered each time. He was inspired by a version of this maxim. At the battle of Cannae, he remarked to Gisco who complained that the Carthaginians were outnumbered by the Romans: “There is one thing that’s more wonderful than their numbers … in all that vast number there is not one man called Gisgo.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a>”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a></p><p id=\"345d\"><em>Unus sed leo: only one but a lion.</em></p><p id=\"a22b\">This large payoff from stubborn courage is not just in the military. The entire growth of society, whether economic or moral, comes from a small number of people. So we close this chapter with a remark about the role of skin in the game in the condition of society. Society doesn’t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meeting, academic conferences, and polling; only a few people suffice to disproportionately move the needle. All one needs is an asymmetric rule somewhere. And asymmetry is present in about everything.</p><h4 id=\"a772\">Notes</h4><p id=\"0f79\"><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Thank Amir-Reza Amini.</p><p id=\"07d9\"><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Thank Arnie Schwarzvogel.</p><p id=\"2589\"><a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Note some minor variations across regions and Islamic sects.

China, robots, disability benefits, minimum wages and jail-time are the biggest culprits, according to a pair of researchers at the University of Maryland.</p><p>The percentage of the U.S. population with jobs sank from a record 64.7% in 2000 to a 28-year low of 58.2% by 2011 before beginning a gradual recovery.

Manufacturing was particularly hard hit — more than 5 million jobs were lost from 1999 to 2016. </p><p>Trade with China flooded the U.S. with cheap imports, forced domestic firms to shift operations overseas and put downward pressure on wages of less-skilled Americans.</p><p>The rise of robots appears to be another critical factor even though the effects of automation are harder to determine, the report said. Think of how many bank jobs have been lost due to ATMs and online banking, for example.</p><p>A smaller but not insignificant factor is an increase in federal disability benefits. The percentage of men ages 25-54 on disability insurance rose by a third since the mid-1980s. Many used to work in manufacturing.</p><p>The disability program plays “an increasingly important role in providing income for less educated workers negatively impacted by” trade, automation and the like, the authors said. A “sizable” number of those approved for disability benefits would have worked if there applications were turned down.</p><p>Higher minimum wages are probably another cause. </p><p>After declining in inflation-adjusted terms from 1998 to 2007, minimum wages rose almost 11% in real terms between 2007 and 2016, Abraham and Kearney estimated. Firms may have outsourced jobs or spent more on automation to offset the higher costs of low-skilled labor.</p><p>A greater percentage of men serving time in jail, especially African Americans, had a similar impact as higher minimum wages. Even though crime rates fell, tighter sentencing laws resulted in more people going to prison.</p><p>The ill effects of a prison sentence also last well beyond time served. Companies are reluctant or unwilling to hire those with criminal records unless they have no choice.</p><h6>Video games not to blame </h6><p>The authors found little evidence to support other popular theories.</p><p>The share of unemployed men with working wives has actually fallen, for instance.The authors also could not find evidence that declining labor-force participation is tied to opioid addiction or more young men playing video games in their parents’ basements. Nor is lack of child care or more people getting food stamps to blame.</p><p>It’s possible these explanations played a role, but more research is needed, Abraham and Kearney said.</p><div><h4>Related Topics</h4><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div><p> Jeffry Bartash is a reporter for MarketWatch in Washington. </p><p> Jeffry Bartash is a reporter for MarketWatch in Washington. </p></div>","score":55,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519501388,"text":"I&#x27;m deeply skeptical of any explanation that claims that we have both a &quot;shortage of labor&quot; <i>and</i> &quot;downward pressure on wages&quot;:<p>&gt; <i>If men and women from the ages 25 to 54 took part in the labor market...

These are jobs where employees must invest a certain amount of time and training to be paid well, and then they find that their entire industry is drying up. They are faced with a few choices, and many of those lead towards a less attractive, lower-paying job than they had before.<p>With a social safety net, many are simply exiting the job market and relying on disability or other means to get by rather than take a crap job at crap wages.<p>Although the age group here is different, a lot of the same forces are likely at play. US employers do not see labor as an investment, and haven&#x27;t for a long time (if ever); they are generally unwilling to hire lower-skilled employees and invest in training them. Instead, they cry constantly that there isn&#x27;t a large enough pool of skilled labor to draw from (and in the tech sector, this is why they think they need lots of H-1Bs).<p>Meanwhile, potential employees are faced with a market where, if they work very hard and teach themselves some skill at their own cost, they might be able to get a job working for an employer who will pay them as little as they can get away with paying them (the wage pressure), and potentially also having to pay off student loans.

Why? Why does this happen with religionand not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk abouton forums?</p><p>What's different about religion is that people don't feel they needto have any particular expertise to have opinions aboutit. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can havethose. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one aboutreligion, because people feel they have to be over some thresholdof expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone'san expert.</p><p>Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics,like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertisefor expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions.</p><p>Do religion and politics have something in common that explainsthis similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal withquestions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressureon people's opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, everyopinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly withtheirs.</p><p>But this isn't true. There are certainly some political questionsthat have definite answers, like how much a new government policywill cost. But the more precise political questions suffer thesame fate as the vaguer ones.</p><p>I think what religion and politics have in common is that theybecome part of people's identity, and people can never have afruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.By definition they're partisan.</p><p>Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, notthe topic. For example, a discussion about a battle that includedcitizens of one or more of the countries involved would probablydegenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today abouta battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. Noone would know what side to be on. So it's not politics that's thesource of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussionhas degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is thatit has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.<1span>[<a href=\"#f1n\"><1span>1<1span></a>]<1span></p><p>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people ratherthan the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a questiontends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,the question of the relative merits of programming languages oftendegenerates into a religious war, because so many programmersidentify as X programmers or Y programmers. This sometimes leadspeople to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that alllanguages are equally good. Obviously that's false: anything elsepeople make can be well or badly designed; why should this beuniquely impossible for programming languages? And indeed, you canhave a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programminglanguages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.</p><p>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topiconly if it doesn't engage the identities of any of theparticipants. What makes politics and religion such minefields isthat they engage so many people's identities. But you could inprinciple have a useful conversation about them with some people.And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like therelative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn'tsafely talk about with <a href=\"http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039\">others</a>.</p><p>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is thatit explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but howto have better ideas. If people can't think clearly about anythingthat has become part of their identity, then all other things beingequal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity aspossible. <1span>[<a href=\"#f2n\"><1span>2<1span></a>]<1span></p><p>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.

They could thus easily communicate with domain experts and separate problem-specific ideas from the details of general-purpose languages and specific program design decisions.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Key Insights</h3><p>In the real world, however, programmers use a mainstream programming language someone else picked for them. To address this conflict, they resort to—and on occasion build their own—domain-specific languages embedded in the chosen language (embedded domain-specific languages, or eDSLs). For example, JavaScript programmers employ jQuery for interacting with the Document Object Model and React for dealing with events and concurrency. As developers solve their problems in appropriate eDSLs, they compose these solutions into one system; that is, they effectively write multilingual software in a common host language.<sup><a href=\"#FNA\">a</a></sup></p><p>Sadly, multilingual eDSL programming is done today on an ad hoc basis and is rather cumbersome. To create and deploy a language, programmers usually must step outside the chosen language to set up configuration files and run compilation tools and link-in the resulting object-code files. Worse, the host languages fail to support the proper and sound integration of components in different eDSLs. Moreover, most available integrated development environments (IDEs) do not even understand eDSLs or perceive the presence of code written in eDSLs.</p><p>The goal of the Racket project is to explore this emerging idea of language-oriented programming, or LOP, at two different levels. At the practical level, the goal is to build a programming language that enables language-oriented software design. This language must facilitate easy creation of eDSLs, immediate development of components in these newly created languages, and integration of components in distinct eDSLs; Racket is available at <a href=\"http://racket-lang.org/\">http://racket-lang.org/</a></p><p>At the conceptual level, the case for LOP is analogous to the ones for object-oriented programming and for concurrency-oriented programming.<sup><a href=\"#R3\">3</a></sup> The former arose from making the creation and manipulation of objects syntactically simple and dynamically cheap, the latter from Erlang's inexpensive process creation and message passing. Both innovations enabled new ways to develop software and triggered research projects. The question is how our discipline will realize LOP and how it will affect the world of software.</p><p>Our decision to develop a new language—Racket—is partly an historical artifact and partly due to our desire to free ourselves from any unnecessary constraints of industrial mainstream languages as we investigate LOP. The next section spells out how Racket got started, how we honed in on LOP, and what the idea of LOP implies.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Principles of Racket</h3><p>The Racket project dates to January 1995 when we started it as a language for experimenting with pedagogic programming languages.<sup><a href=\"#R15\">15</a></sup> Working on them quickly taught us that a language itself is a problem-solving tool. We soon found ourselves developing different languages for different parts of the project: a (meta-) language for expressing many pedagogic languages, another for specializing the DrRacket IDE,<sup><a href=\"#R15\">15</a></sup> and a third for managing configurations. In the end, the software was a multilingual system, as outlined earlier.</p><p>Racket's guiding principle reflects the insight we gained: empower programmers to create new programming languages easily and add them with a friction-free process to a codebase. By \"language,\" we mean a new syntax, a static semantics, and a dynamic semantics that usually maps the new syntax to elements of the host language and possibly external languages via a foreign-function interface (FFI). For a concrete example, see <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg\">Figure 1</a> for a diagram of the architecture of a recently developed pair of scripting languages for video editing<sup><a href=\"#R2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#FNB\">b</a></sup> designed to assist people who turn recordings of conference presentations into YouTube videos and channels. Most of that work is repetitive—adding preludes and post-ludes, concatenating playlists, and superimposing audio—with few steps demanding manual intervention. This task calls for a domain-specific scripting language; video is a declarative eDSL that meets this need.</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg\"><img alt=\"f1.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f1.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 1. Small language-oriented programming example.</strong></p><p>The <code>typed/video</code> language adds a type system to <code>video</code>. Clearly, the domain of type systems comes with its own language of expertise, and <code>typed/video's</code> implementation thus uses <code>turnstile</code>,<sup><a href=\"#R6\">6</a></sup> an eDSL created for expressing type systems. Likewise, the implementation of <code>video</code>'s rendering facility calls for bindings to a multimedia framework. Ours separates the binding definitions from the repetitive details of FFI calls, yielding two parts: an eDSL for multimedia FFIs, dubbed <code>video/ffi</code>, and a single program in the eDSL. Finally, in support of creating all these eDSLs, Racket comes with the <code>syntax parse</code> eDSL,<sup><a href=\"#R7\">7</a></sup> which targets eDSL creation.</p><p>The LOP principle implies two subsidiary guidelines:</p><p><em>Enable creators of a language to enforce its invariants.</em> A programming language is an abstraction, and abstractions are about integrity. Java, for example, comes with memory safety and type soundness. When a program consists of pieces in different languages, values flow from one context into another and need protection from operations that might violate their integrity, as we discuss later; and</p><hr/><blockquote><p><em>Most notably, Racket eliminates the hard boundary between library and language, overcoming a seemingly intractable conflict.</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p><em>Turn extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs.</em> A LOP programmer who resorts to extra-linguistic mechanisms effectively acknowledges that the chosen language lacks expressive power.<sup>13,<a href=\"#FNC\">c</a></sup> The numerous external languages required to deal with Java projects—a configuration language, a project description language, and a <code>makefile</code> language—represent symptoms of this problem. We treat such gaps as challenges later in the article.</p><p>They have been developed in a feedback loop that includes DrRacket<sup><a href=\"#R15\">15</a></sup> plus typed,<sup><a href=\"#R36\">36</a></sup> lazy,<sup><a href=\"#R4\">4</a></sup> and pedagogical languages.<sup><a href=\"#R15\">15</a></sup></p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Libraries and Languages Reconciled</h3><p>Racket is an heir of Lisp and Scheme. Unlike these ancestors, however, Racket emphasizes functional over imperative programming without enforcing an ideology. Racket is agnostic when it comes to surface syntax, accommodating even conventional variants (such as Algol 60).<sup><a href=\"#FND\">d</a></sup> Like many languages, Racket comes with \"batteries included.\"</p><p>Most notably, Racket eliminates the hard boundary between library and language, overcoming a seemingly intractable conflict. In practice, this means new linguistic constructs are as seamlessly imported as functions and classes from libraries and packages. For example, Racket's class system and <code>for</code> loops are imports from plain libraries, yet most programmers use these constructs without ever noticing their nature as user-defined concepts.</p><p>Racket's key innovation is a modular syntax system,<sup><a href=\"#R17\">17</a>,<a href=\"#R26\">26</a></sup> an improvement over Scheme's macro system,<sup><a href=\"#R11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#R24\">24</a>,<a href=\"#R25\">25</a></sup> which in turn improved on Lisp's tree-transformation system. A Racket module provides such services as functions, classes, and linguistic constructs. To implement them, a module may require the services of other modules. In this world of modules, creating a new language means simply creating a module that provides the services for a language. Such a module may subtract linguistic constructs from a base language, reinterpret others, and add a few new ones. A language is rarely built from scratch.</p><p>Like Unix shell scripts, which specify their dialect on the first line, every Racket module specifies its language on the first line, too. This language specification refers to a file that contains a language-defining module. Creating this file is all it takes to install a language built in Racket. Practically speaking, a programmer may develop a language in one tab of the IDE, while another tab may be a module written in the language of the first. Without ever leaving the IDE to run compilers, linkers, or other tools, the developer can modify the language implementation in the first tab and immediately experience the modification in the second; that is, language development is a friction-free process in Racket.</p><p>In the world of shell scripts, the first-line convention eventually opened the door to a slew of alternatives to shells, including Perl, Python, and Ruby. The Racket world today reflects a similar phenomenon, with language libraries proliferating within its ecosystem: <code>racket/base</code>, the Racket core language; <code>racket</code>, the \"batteries included\" variant; and <code>typed/racket</code>, a typed variant. Some lesser-known examples are <code>datalog</code> and a <code>web-server</code> language.<sup><a href=\"#R27\">27</a>,<a href=\"#R30\">30</a></sup> When precision is needed, we use the lowercase name of the language in typewriter font; otherwise we use just \"Racket.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg\">Figure 2</a> is an illustrative module. Its first line—pronounced \"hash lang racket base\"—says it is written in <code>racket/base.</code> The module provides a single function, <code>walk-simplex.</code> The accompanying line comments—introduced with semicolons—informally state a type definition and a function signature in terms of this type definition; later, we show how developers can use <code>typed/racket</code> to replace such comments with statically checked types, as in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg\">Figure 5</a>. To implement this function, the module imports functionality from the <code>constraints</code> module outlined in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg\">Figure 3</a>. The last three lines of <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg\">Figure 2</a> sketch the definition of the <code>walk-simplex</code> function, which refers to the <code>maximizer</code> function imported from constraints.</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg\"><img alt=\"f2.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 2.

A module for describing a simplex shape.</strong></p><p>The \"<code>constraints</code>\" module in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg\">Figure 3</a> expresses the implementation of its only service in a domain-specific language because it deals with simplexes, which are naturally expressed through a system of inequalities. The module's <code>simplex</code> language inherits the line-comment syntax from <code>racket/base</code> but uses infix syntax otherwise. As the comments state, the module exports a single function, <code>maximizer</code>, which consumes two optional keyword parameters. When called as (<code>maximizer #:xn</code>), as in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f2.jpg\">Figure 2</a>, it produces the maximal y value of the system of constraints. As in the lower half of <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f3.jpg\">Figure 3</a>, these constraints are specified with conventional syntax.</p><hr/><blockquote><p><em>In general, cooperating multilingual components must respect the invariants established by each participating language.</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p>In support of this kind of programming, Racket's modular syntax system benefits from several key innovations. A particularly illustrative one is the ability to incrementally redefine the meaning of existing language constructs via the module system. It allows eDSL creators to ease their users into a new language by reusing familiar syntax, but reinterpreted.</p><p>Consider <code>lambda</code> expressions, for example. Suppose a developer wishes to equip a scripting language (such as <code>video</code>) with functions that check whether their arguments satisfy specified predicates. <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg\">Figure 4</a> shows the basic idea:</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg\"><img alt=\"f4.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 4.

This one uses <code>syntax-parse</code> from the library mentioned earlier. Its first piece specifies the to-be-matched tree (<code>stx</code>); the remainder specifies a series of pattern-responses clauses.</p><p><em>line 10</em> This pattern matches any syntax tree with first token as <code>new-lambda</code> followed by a parameter specification and a body. The annotation :id demands that the pattern variables x and <code>predicate</code> match only identifiers in the respective positions. Likewise, :<code>expr</code> allows only expressions to match the body pattern variable.</p><p><em>line 11</em> A compile-time function synthesizes new trees with <code>syntax.</code></p><p><em>line 12</em> The generated syntax tree is a <code>lambda</code> expression. Specifically, the function generates an expression that uses <code>lambda.</code> The underline in the code marks its origin as the ambient language, here <code>racket.</code></p><p><em>other lines</em> Wherever the syntax system encounters the pattern variables <code>x, predicate</code>, and <code>body</code>, it inserts the respective subtrees that match x, predicate, and body.</p><p>When another module uses \"<code>new-lam</code>\" as its language, the compiler elaborates the surface syntax into the core language like this</p><blockquote><p><code>(lambda (x :: integer?) (+ x 1))</code><br/> -elaborates to→<br/><code><img alt=\"cacm6103_i.gif\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/cacm6103_i.gif\"/> (x :: integer?)

Finally, the <code>new-lambda</code> compile-time function translates the given syntax tree into a <code>racket</code> function.</p><p>Inessence, <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f4.jpg\">Figure 4</a> implements a simplistic precondition system for one-argument functions. Next, the language developer might wish to introduce multiargument <code>lambda</code> expressions, add a position for specifying the post-condition, or make the annotations optional. Naturally, the compile-time functions could then be modified to check some or all of these annotations statically, eventually resulting in a language that resembles <code>typed/racket.</code></p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Sound Cooperation Between Languages</h3><p>A LOP-based software system consists of multiple cooperating components, each written in domain-specific languages. Cooperation means the components exchange values, while \"multiple languages\" implies these values are created in distinct languages. In this setting, things can easily go wrong, as demonstrated in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg\">Figure 5</a> with a toy scenario. On the left, a module written in <code>typed/racket</code> exports a numeric differentiation function. On the right, a module written in <code>racket</code> imports this function and applies it in three different ways, all illegal. If such illegal uses of the function were to go undiscovered, developers would not be able to rely on type information for designing functions or for debugging, nor could compilers rely on them for optimizations. In general, cooperating multilingual components must respect the invariants established by each participating language.</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg\"><img alt=\"f5.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f5.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 5. Protecting invariants.</strong></p><p>In the real world, programming languages satisfy a spectrum of guarantees about invariants. For example, C++ is unsound. A running C++ program may apply any operation to any bit pattern and, as long as the hardware does not object, program execution continues. The program may even terminate \"normally,\" printing all kinds of output after the misinterpretation of the bits. In contrast, Java does not allow the misrepresentation of bits but is only somewhat more sound than C++.<sup><a href=\"#R1\">1</a></sup> ML improves on Java again and is completely sound, with no value ever manipulated by an inappropriate operation.</p><p>Racket aims to mirror this spectrum of soundness at two levels: language implementation itself and cooperation between two components written in different embedded languages. First consider the soundness of languages. As the literature on domain-specific languages suggests,<sup><a href=\"#R20\">20</a></sup> such languages normally evolve in a particular manner, as is true for the Racket world, as in <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg\">Figure 6</a>. A first implementation is often a thin veneer over an efficient C-level API. Racket developers create such a veneer with a foreign interface that allows parenthesized C-level programming.<sup><a href=\"#R5\">5</a></sup> Programmers can refer to a C library, import functions and data structures, and wrap these imports in Racket values. <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg\">Figure 7</a> illustrates the idea with a sketch of a module; <code>video's</code> initial implementation consisted of just such a set of bindings to a video-rendering framework. When a <code>racket/base</code> module imports the <code>ffi/unsafe</code> library, the language of the module is unsound.</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg\"><img alt=\"f6.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f6.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 6. Hardening a module.</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg\"><img alt=\"f7.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f7.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 7. A Racket module using the foreign-function interface.</strong></p><p>A language developer who starts with an unsound eDSL is likely to make it sound as the immediate next step. To this end, the language is equipped with runtime checks similar to those found in dynamically typed scripting languages to prevent the flow of bad values to unsound primitives. Unfortunately, such protection is ad hoc, and, unless developers are hypersensitive, the error messages may originate from inside the library, thus blaming some <code>racket/base</code> primitive operation for the error. To address this problem, Racket comes with higher-order contracts<sup><a href=\"#R16\">16</a></sup> with which a language developer might uniformly protect the API of a library from bad values. For example, the <code>video/ffi</code> language provides language constructs for making the bindings to the video-rendering framework safe. In addition to plain logical assertions, Racket's developers are also experimenting with contracts for checking protocols, especially temporal ones.<sup><a href=\"#R9\">9</a></sup> The built-in blame mechanism of the contract library ensures sound blame assignment.<sup><a href=\"#R10\">10</a></sup></p><p>Finally, a language developer may wish to check some logical invariants <em>before</em> the programs run. Checking simple types is one example, though other forms of static checking are also possible. The <code>typed/video</code> language illustrates this point with a type system that checks the input and output types of functions that may include numeric constraints on the integer arguments; as a result, no script can possibly render a video of negative length. Likewise, <code>typed/racket</code> is a typed variant of (most of) racket.</p><p>Now consider the soundness of cooperating languages. It is again up to the language developer to anticipate how programs in this language interact with others. For example, the creator of <code>typed/video</code> provides no protection for its programs. In contrast, the creators of <code>typed/racket</code> intended the language to be used in a multilingual context; <code>typed/racket</code> thus compiles the types of exported functions into the higher-order contracts mentioned. When, for example, an exported function must always be applied to integer values, the generated contract inserts a check that ensures the \"integerness\" of the argument at every application site for this function; there is no need to insert such a check for the function's return points because the function is statically type checked. For a function that consumes an integer-valued function, the contract must ensure the function argument always returns an integer. In general, a contract wraps exported values with a proxy<sup><a href=\"#R31\">31</a></sup> that controls access to the value. The idea is due to Matthews and Findler,<sup><a href=\"#R29\">29</a></sup> while Tobin-Hochstadt's and Felleisen's Blame Theorem<sup><a href=\"#R35\">35</a></sup> showed that if something goes wrong with such a mixed system, the runtime exception points to two faulty components and their boundary as the source of the problem.<sup><a href=\"#R10\">10</a></sup> In general, Racket supplies a range of protection mechanisms, and a language creator can use them to implement a range of soundness guarantees for cooperating eDSLs.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Universality vs. Expressiveness</h3><p>Just because a general-purpose language can compute all partial-recursive functions, programmers cannot necessarily express all their ideas about programs in this language.<sup><a href=\"#R13\">13</a></sup> This point is best illustrated through an example. So, imagine the challenge of building an IDE for a new programming language in the very same language. Like any modern IDE, it is supposed to enable users to compile and run their code. If the code goes into an infinite loop, the user must be able to terminate it with a simple mouse click. To implement this capability in a natural<sup><a href=\"#FNE\">e</a></sup> manner, the language must internalize the idea of a controllable process, a thread. If it does not internalize such a notion, the implementer of the IDE must step outside the language and somehow re-use processes from the underlying operating system.</p><p>For a programming language researcher, \"stepping outside the language\" signals failure. Or, as Ingalls<sup><a href=\"#R21\">21</a></sup> said, \"[an] operating system is a collection of things that don't fit into a language[; t]here shouldn't be one.\" We, Racket creators, have sought to identify services Racket borrows from the surrounding operating system and assimilate them into the language itself.<sup><a href=\"#R19\">19</a></sup> Here are three sample constructs for which programmers used to step outside of Racket but no longer need to:</p><p><em>Sandboxes.</em> That restrict access to resources;</p><p><em>Inspectors.</em> That control reflective capabilities; and</p><p><em>Custodians.</em> That manage resources (such as threads and sockets).</p><p>To understand how inclusion of such services helps language designers, consider a 2014 example, the <code>shill</code> language.<sup><a href=\"#R32\">32</a></sup> Roughly speaking, <code>shill</code> is a secure scripting language in Racket's ecosystem. With <code>shill</code>, a developer articulates fine-grain security and resource policies—along with, say, what files a function may access or what binaries the script may run—and the language ensures these constraints are satisfied. To make this concrete, consider a homework server to which students can submit their programs. The instructor might wish to run an autograde process for all submissions. Using a <code>shill</code> script, the homework server can execute student programs that cannot successfully attack the server, poke around in the file system for solutions, or access external connections to steal other students' solutions. Naturally, <code>shill's</code> implementation makes extensive use of Racket's means of running code in sandboxes and harvesting resources via custodians.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>State of Affairs</h3><p>The preceding sections explained how Racket enables programmers to do the following:</p><p><em>Create languages.</em> Create by way of linguistic reuse for specific tasks and aspects of a problem;</p><p><em>Equip with soundness.</em> Equip a language with almost any conventional level of soundness, as found in ordinary language implementations; and</p><p><em>Exploit services.</em> Exploit a variety of internalized operating system services for constructing runtime libraries for these embedded languages.</p><p>What makes such language-oriented programming work is \"incrementality,\" or the ability to develop languages in small pieces, step by step. If conventional syntax is not a concern, developers can create new languages from old ones, one construct at a time. Likewise, they do not have to deliver a sound and secure product all at once; they can thus create a new language as a wrapper around, say, an existing C-level library, gradually tease out more of the language from the interface, and make the language as sound or secure as time permits or a growing user base demands.</p><hr/><blockquote><p><em>Racket borrows from the surrounding operating system and assimilates such extra-linguistic mechanisms into the language itself.</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p>Moreover, the entire process takes place within the Racket ecosystem. A developer creates a language as a Racket module and installs it by \"importing\" it into another module. This tight coupling has two implications: the development tools of the ecosystem can be used for creating language modules and their clients; and the language becomes available for creating more languages. Large projects often employ a tower involving a few dozen languages, all helping manage the daunting complexity in modern software systems.</p><p>Sony's <em>Naughty Dog</em> game studio has created just such a large project, actually a framework for creating projects. Roughly speaking, Sony's Racket-based architecture provides languages for describing scenes, transitions between scenes, scores for scenes, and more. Domain specialists use the languages to describe aspects of the game. The Racket implementation composes these domain-specific programs, then compiles them into dynamically linked libraries for a C-based game engine; <a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg\">Figure 8</a> sketches the arrangement graphically.</p><p><a href=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg\"><img alt=\"f8.jpg\" src=\"http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3130000/3127323/f8.jpg\"/></a><br/><strong>Figure 8. A sketch of an industrial example of language-oriented programming.</strong></p><p>Racket's approach to language-oriented programming is by no means perfect. To start with, recognizing when a library should become a language requires a discriminating judgment call. The next steps require good choices in terms of linguistic constructs, syntax, and runtime primitives.</p><p>As for concrete syntax, Racket currently has strong support for typical, incremental Lisp-style syntax development, including traditional support for conventional syntax, or generating lexers and parsers. While traditional parsing introduces the natural separation between surface syntax and meaning mentioned earlier, it also means the development process is no longer incremental. The proper solution would be to inject Racket ideas into a context where conventional syntax is the default.<sup><a href=\"#FNF\">f</a></sup></p><p>As for static checking, Racket forces language designers to develop such checkers wholesale, not incrementally. The type checker for <code>typed/racket</code> looks like, for example, the type checker for any conventionally typed language; it is a complete recursive-descent algorithm that traverses the module's representation and algebraically checks types. What Racket developers really want is a way to attach type-checking rules to linguistic constructs, so such algorithms can be synthesized as needed.</p><p>Chang et al.<sup><a href=\"#R6\">6</a></sup> probably took a first step toward a solution for this problem and have thus far demonstrated how their approach can equip a DSL with any structural type system in an incremental and modular manner. A fully general solution must also cope with substructural type systems (such as the Rust programming language) and static program analyses (such as those found in most compilers).</p><p>As for dynamic checking, Racket suffers from two notable limitations: On one hand, it provides the building blocks for making language cooperation sound, but developers must create the necessary soundness harnesses on an ad hoc basis. To facilitate the composition of components in different languages, Racket developers need both a theoretical framework and abstractions for the partial automation of this task. On the other hand, the available spectrum of soundness mechanisms lacks power at both ends, and how to integrate these powers seamlessly is unclear. To achieve full control over its context, Racket probably needs access to assembly languages on all possible platforms, from hardware to browsers. To realize the full power of types, <code>typed/racket</code> will have to be equipped with dependent types. For example, when a Racket program uses vectors, its corresponding typed variant type-checks what goes into them and what comes out, but like ML or Haskell, indexing is left to a (contractual) check in the runtime system. Tobin-Hochstadt and his Typed Racket group are working on first steps in this direction, focusing on numeric constraints,<sup><a href=\"#R23\">23</a></sup> similar to Xi's and Pfenning's research.<sup><a href=\"#R37\">37</a></sup></p><hr/><blockquote><p><em>To achieve full control over its context, Racket probably needs access to assembly languages on all possible platforms, from hardware to browsers.</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p>As for security, the Racket project is still looking for a significant break-through. While the <code>shill</code> team was able to construct the language inside the Racket ecosystem, its work exposed serious gaps between Racket's principle of language-oriented programming and its approach to enforcing security policies. It thus had to alter many of Racket's security mechanisms and invent new ones. Racket must clearly make this step much easier, meaning more research is needed to turn security into an integral part of language creation.</p><p>Finally, LOP also poses brand-new challenges for tool builders. An IDE typically provides tools for a single programming language or a family of related languages, including debuggers, tracers, and profilers. Good tools communicate with developers in terms of the source language. Due to its very nature, LOP calls for customization of such tools to many languages, along with their abstractions and invariants. We have partially succeeded in building a tool for debugging programs in the syntax language,<sup><a href=\"#R8\">8</a></sup> have the foundations of a debugging framework,<sup><a href=\"#R28\">28</a></sup> and started to explore how to infer scoping rules and high-level semantics for newly introduced, language-level abstractions.<sup><a href=\"#R33\">33</a>,<a href=\"#R34\">34</a></sup> Customizing these tools automatically to newly created (combinations of) languages remains an open challenge.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Programming language research is short of its ultimate goal—provide software developers tools for formulating solutions in the languages of problem domains. Racket is one attempt to continue the search for proper linguistic abstractions. While it has achieved remarkable success in this direction, it also shows that programming-language research has many problems to address before the vision of language-oriented programming becomes reality.</p><p><a href=\"#PageTop\">Back to Top</a></p><h3>Acknowledgments</h3><p>We thank Claire Alvis, Robert Cart-wright, Ryan Culpepper, John Clements, Stephen Chang, Richard Cob-be, Greg Cooper, Christos Dimoulas, Bruce Duba, Carl Eastlund, Burke Fetscher, Cormac Flanagan, Kathi Fisler, Dan Friedman, Tony Garnock Jones, Paul Graunke, Dan Grossman, Kathy Gray, Casey Klein, Eugene Kohlbecker, Guillaume Marceau, Jacob Matthews, Scott Owens, Greg Pettyjohn, Jon Rafkind, Vincent St-Amour, Paul Steckler, Stevie Strickland, James Swaine, Asumu Takikawa, Kevin Tew, Neil Toronto, and Adam Wick for their contributions.</p><p>A preliminary version of this article appeared in the <em>Proceedings of the First Summit on Advances in Programming Languages</em> conference in 2015.<sup><a href=\"#R14\">14</a></sup> In addition to its reviewers, Sam Caldwell, Eduardo Cavazos, John Clements, Byron Davies, Ben Greenman, Greg Hendershott, Manos Renieris, Marc Smith, Vincent St-Amour, and Asumu Takikawa suggested improvements to the presentation of this material.

The method is implemented in a second-year course in computationalphysics at Lebanon Valley College. We argue that the structure of Newtonianmechanics is clarified by its expression in a language (Haskell) that supportshigher-order functions, types, and type classes. In electromagnetic theory, thetype signatures of functions that calculate electric and magnetic fieldsclearly express the functional dependency on the charge and currentdistributions that produce the fields. Many of the ideas in basic physics arewell-captured by a type or a function.</blockquote><div><h2>Submission history</h2>From: EPTCS [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/show-email/542fa9ac/1412.4880\">view email</a>]<br/><b>[v1]</b> Tue, 16 Dec 2014 05:14:30 GMT (15kb)<br/></div><div><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/auth/show-endorsers/1412.4880\">Which authors of this paper are endorsers?</a> | <a id=\"mathjax_toggle\" href=\"javascript:setMathjaxCookie()\">Disable MathJax</a> (<a href=\"/help/mathjax/\">What is MathJax?</a>)</div></div></div>","score":267,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519484906,"text":"So the Haskell version of [1] (in scheme)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Classical_Mechanics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structure_and_Interpretation_o...</a><p>[Free book] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;titles&#x2F;content&#x2F;sicm_edition_2&#x2F;book.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;titles&#x2F;content&#x2F;...</a>","parent":16453192,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519497838,"text":"heh first thing that came to mind.

The set up requires each hand to independently form a loop with an opposite twist without the benefit of the other hand to brace the rest of the shoelace against.<p>The gif of the knot does not show the set up, which is kind of unfair to the standard knot since that part is fundamentally baked-in to the standard knot. I&#x27;d love to see a video of the creator doing this from the start, because he probably is pretty good at the set-up which is just as important.<p>I think part of the reason why I don&#x27;t find this faster is because I use the more modern style of flat&#x2F;ovaloid shoelaces. Round shoelaces don&#x27;t really get &quot;twisted&quot;, and linen shoelaces are pliable enough for it to not matter, which means you could roll the laces around in your hand to get them to the starting position for Ian&#x27;s knot. With the laces in basketball&#x2F;running shoes, I think you need a bit more dexterity to manipulate the laces to get them to the point where they are &#x27;flat&#x27; than could be managed with Ian&#x27;s knot.<p>I don&#x27;t think switching to Ian&#x27;s knot and round laces would save me much time overall; the reason I like flat athletic laces is because I never have issues with the knot coming undone, loosening, or stretching&#x2F;tightening. I use round laces on my work boots because flat laces are hard to untie if they get gritty, and I always have to double-knot them or they come undone. Since this is identical to the standard knot, I&#x27;m sure that would continue to be a problem, and I think the set-up for the standard knot makes double-knotting easier as well.<p>As a final note, my best friend ties his dress shoes this way (with the really narrow laces), and it is definitely faster all things equal. I think those narrow laces are probably the best use for this method.<p>All that being said, I originally found this site while looking for lacing methods, and it&#x27;s one of my favorite sites on the internet.

Now, there was a clear new moon, as was usual at that phase, its horns extended to the east; and behold suddenly the upper horn was divided in two. Out of the middle of its division a burning torch sprang, throwing out a long way, flames, coals and sparks. As well, the moon's body which was lower, twisted as though anxious, and in the words of those who told me and had seen it with their own eyes, the moon palpitated like a pummelled snake. After this it returned to its proper state. This vicissitude repeated itself a dozen times or more, namely that the fire took on tormented forms variously at random, and afterwards returned to its prior state. Even after these vicissitudes, from horn to horn, that means along its length, it became semi-black.

He added that the people of the time would have agreed with him —but for entirely the wrong reasons.<br/>     They would have pointed, often with justified pride, to the era’s scientific achievements — the conquest of the air, the release of atomic energy, the discovery of the basic principles of life, the electronics and communications revolution, the beginnings of artificial intelligence — and most spectacular of all, the exploration of the solar system and the first landing on the Moon. But as the historian pointed out, with the 20/20 accuracy of hindsight, not one in a thousand would even have heard of the discovery that transcended all these events by threatening to make them utterly irrelevant.<br/>     It seemed as harmless, and as far from human affairs, as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay#History_of_discovery\">fogged photographic plate in Becquerel’s laboratory</a> that led, in only fifty years, to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki\">fireball above Hiroshima</a>. Indeed, it was a by-product of that same research, and began in equal innocence.<br/>     Nature is a very strict accountant, and always balances her books. So physicists were extremely puzzled when they discovered certain nuclear reactions in which, after all the fragments were added up, something seemed to be missing on one side of the equation.<br/>     Like a bookkeeper hastily replenishing the petty cash to keep one jump ahead of the auditors, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#Pauli.27s_proposal\">the physicists were forced to invent a new particle</a>. And, to account for the discrepancy, it had to be a most peculiar one — with neither mass nor charge, and <a href=\"http://www.astronomynotes.com/starsun/s4.htm\">so fantastically penetrating that it could pass, without noticeable inconvenience, through a wall of lead billions of kilometres thick</a>.<br/>     This phantom was given the nickname ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino\">neutrino</a>’ — neutron plus <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambino\">bambino</a>. There seemed no hope of ever detecting so elusive an entity; but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reines#Discovery_of_the_neutrino_and_the_inner_workings_of_stars\">in 1956, by heroic feats of instrumentation, the physicists had caught the first few specimens</a>. It was also a triumph for the theoreticians, who now found their unlikely equations verified.<br/>     The world as a whole neither knew nor cared; but the countdown to doomsday had begun.<br/><hr/>     No one heard the first tolling of Earth’s funeral bell — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestake_experiment\">not even the scientists who made the fatal discovery, far underground, in an abandoned Colorado gold mine</a>.<br/>     It was a daring experiment, quite inconceivable before the mid-twentieth century. Once the neutrino had been detected, it was quickly realized that mankind had a new window on the universe. Something so penetrating that it passed through a planet as easily as light through a sheet of glass could be used to look into the hearts of suns.<br/>     Especially the Sun. Astronomers were confident that they understood the reactions powering the solar furnace, upon which all life on Earth ultimately depended. At the enormous pressures and temperatures at the Sun’s core, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem#Introduction\">hydrogen was fused to helium, in a series of reactions that liberated vast amounts of energy. And, as an incidental by-product, neutrinos</a>.<br/>     Finding the trillions of tons of matter in their way no more obstacle than a wisp of smoke, those solar neutrinos raced up from their birthplace at the velocity of light. Just two seconds later they emerged into space, and spread outward across the universe. However many stars and planets they encountered, most of them would still have evaded capture by the insubstantial ghost of ‘solid’ matter when Time itself came to an end.<br/>     Eight minutes after they had left the Sun, a tiny fraction of the solar torrent swept through the Earth — and an even smaller fraction was intercepted by the scientists in Colorado. They had buried their equipment more than a kilometre underground so that all the less penetrating radiations would be filtered out and they could trap the rare, genuine messengers from the heart of the Sun. By counting the captured neutrinos, they hoped to study in detail conditions at a spot that, as any philosopher could easily prove, was forever barred from human knowledge or observation.<br/>     The experiment worked; solar neutrinos were detected. But —there were far too few of them. There should have been three or four times as many as the massive instrumentation had succeeded in capturing.<br/>     Clearly, something was wrong, and during the 1970s the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem\">Case of the Missing Neutrinos</a> escalated to a major scientific scandal. Equipment was checked and rechecked, theories were overhauled, and the experiment rerun scores of times — always with the same baffling result.<br/>     By the end of the twentieth century, the astrophysicists had been forced to accept a disturbing conclusion — though as yet, no one realized its full implications.<br/>     There was nothing wrong with the theory, or with the equipment. <strong>The trouble lay inside the Sun.</strong><br/>     The first secret meeting in the history of the International Astronomical Union took place in 2008 at Aspen, Colorado — not far from the scene of the original experiment, which had now been repeated in a dozen countries. A week later IAU Special Bulletin No. 55/08, bearing the deliberately low-key title ‘Some Notes on Solar Reactions’, was in the hands of every government on Earth.<br/><p>(ed note: the novel was written in 1986, then the year 2008 was two decades in the future)</p>     One might have thought that as the news slowly leaked out, the announcement of the End of the World would have produced a certain amount of panic. In fact, the general reaction was a stunned silence — then a shrug of the shoulders and the resumption of normal, everyday business.<br/>     Few governments had ever looked more than an election ahead, few individuals beyond the lifetimes of their grandchildren. And anyway, the astronomers might be wrong. Even if humanity was under sentence of death, the date of execution was still indefinite. The Sun would not blow up for at least a thousand years, and who could weep for the fortieth generation?</div><div><p>Better still, although the origins of both Deimos and Phobos are yet unsettled, both appear to have the characteristics of dark carbonaceous asteroids, with anhydrous silicates, carbon, organic compounds, and ice (Bell et al. 1992). If this bears out, <strong>Deimos’ regolith would be able to provide water and other volatiles for life support and propellant.</strong> Besides silicates, its regolith will also likely contain metals and other valuable materials for construction and manufacturing (Norton 2002).</p></div><div><p>In <a href=\"http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2725/1\">this plan</a>, I find it hard to see any good in wasting money and time on the Moon step. Deimos requires less delta-v to get to/from anyway. If it can be exploited for oxygen propellant, then it would be a better place to get it than the Moon (which has a rather steep gravity well).</p><p>Also, while I'm generally wary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tether\">tether schemes</a>, I must admit that they might be useful for transferring stuff from Deimos to Earth. Deimos starts off in a somewhat inconvenient circular orbit. One or more rotating tethers made out of \"waste\" metal from oxygen extraction could be used to sling payloads into an elliptical orbit more suitable for navigation back to Earth.</p><p>That said, I really think it's better to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_fluid_accumulator\">get oxygen from Earth's atmosphere</a> or maybe Venus or Mars. Much simpler processing, and uses mostly off the shelf satellite technology.﻿</p></div><div><p>But the glory of the rings continually drew Bowman’s eye away from the planet; in their complexity of detail, and delicacy of shading, they were a universe in themselves. In addition to the great main gap between the inner and outer rings, there were at least fifty other subdivisions or boundaries, where there were distinct changes in the brightness of the planet’s gigantic halo. It was as if Saturn was surrounded by scores of concentric hoops, all touching each other, all so flat that they might have been cut from the thinnest possible paper. The system of the rings looked like some delicate work of art, or a fragile toy to be admired but never touched. By no effort of the will could Bowman really appreciate its true scale, and convince himself that the whole planet Earth, if set down here, would look like a ball bearing rolling round the rim of a dinner plate.</p><p>Sometimes a star would drift behind the rings, losing only a little of its brilliancy as it did so. It would continue to shine through their translucent material — though often it would twinkle slightly as some larger fragment of orbiting debris eclipsed it.</p><p>For the rings, as had been known since the nineteenth century, were not solid: that was a mechanical impossibility. They consisted of countless myriads of fragments — perhaps the remains of a moon that had come too close and had been torn to pieces by the great planet’s tidal pull. Whatever their origin, the human race was fortunate to have seen such a wonder; it could exist for only a brief moment of time in the history of the Solar System.</p><p>As long ago as 1945, a British astronomer had pointed out that the rings were ephemeral; gravitational forces were at work which would soon destroy them. Taking this argument backward in time, it therefore followed that they had been created only recently — a mere two or three million years ago.</p><p><strong>But no one had ever given the slightest thought to the curious coincidence that the rings of Saturn had been born at the same time as the human race.</strong></p></div><div><p>So the world soon forgot about Rama; but the astronomers did not. Their excitement grew with the passing months, as the new asteroid presented them with more and more puzzles.</p><p>First of all, there was the problem of Rama's light curve. It didn't have one.</p><p>All known asteroids, without exception, showed a slow variation in their brilliance, waxing and waning within a period of a few hours. It had been recognized for more than two centuries that this was an inevitable result of their spin, and their irregular shape. As they toppled end over end along their orbits the reflecting surfaces they presented to the sun were continually changing, and their brightness varied accordingly.</p><p>Rama showed no such changes. Either it was not spinning at all or it was perfectly symmetrical. Both explanations seemed equally unlikely.</p><hr/><p>The sunlight reflected from Rama was not, after all, absolutely constant in its intensity. There was a very small variation—hard to detect, but quite unmistakable, and extremely regular. Like all the other asteroids, Rama was indeed spinning. But whereas the normal 'day' for an asteroid was several hours, Rama's was only four minutes.</p><p>Dr. Stenton did some quick calculations, and found it hard to believe the results. At its equator, this tiny world must be spinning at more than a thousand kilometres an hour; it would be rather unhealthy to attempt a landing anywhere except at the poles. The centrifugal force at Rama's equator must be powerful enough to flick any loose objects away from it at an acceleration of almost one gravity. Rama was a rolling stone that could never have gathered any cosmic moss; it was surprising that such a body had managed to hold itself together, and had not long ago shattered into a million fragments.</p><p>An object forty kilometres across, with a rotation period of only four minutes—where did that fit into the astronomical scheme of things? Dr. Stenton was a somewhat imaginative man, a little too prone to jump to conclusions. He now jumped to one which gave him a very uncomfortable few minutes indeed.</p><p>The only specimen of the celestial zoo that fitted this description was a collapsed star. Perhaps Rama was a dead sun—a madly spinning sphere of neutronium, every cubic centimetre weighing billions of tons .</p><hr/><p>Three months later the space probe, rechristened Sita, was launched from Phobos, the inner moon of Mars. The flight time was seven weeks, and the instrument was switched to full power only five minutes before interception. Simultaneously, a cluster of camera pods was released, to sail past Rama so that it could be photographed from all sides.</p><p>The first images, from ten thousand kilometres away, brought to a halt the activities of all mankind. On a billion television screens, there appeared a tiny, featureless cylinder, growing rapidly second by second. By the time it had doubled its size, no one could pretend any longer that Rama was a natural object.</p><p>Its body was a cylinder so geometrically perfect that it might have been turned on a lathe—one with centres fifty kilometres apart. The two ends were quite flat, apart from some small structures at the centre of one face, and were twenty kilometres across; from a distance, when there was no sense of scale, Rama looked almost comically like an ordinary domestic boiler.</p><p>Rama grew until it filled the screen. Its surface was a dull, drab grey, as colourless as the Moon, and completely devoid of markings except at one point. Halfway along the cylinder there was a kilometre-wide stain or smear, as if something had once hit and splattered, ages ago.</p><p>There was no sign that the impact had done the slightest damage to Rama's spinning walls; but this mark had produced the slight fluctuation in brightness that had led to Stenton's discovery.</p><p>The images from the other cameras added nothing new. However, the trajectories their pods traced through Rama's minute gravitational field gave one other vital piece of information—the mass of the cylinder.</p><p>It was far too light to be a solid body. To nobody's great surprise, it was clear that Rama must be hollow.</p><p>The long-hoped-for, long-feared encounter had come at last. Mankind was about to receive its first visitor from the stars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz's_star\">Scholz's star</a> (full designation WISE J072003.20-084651.2) is a binary star system with a dim little <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification\">spectral class</a> M9 and an even dimmer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_T\">T5 brown dwarf</a>. It is currently about 17 to 23 light-years away.</p><p>But it wasn't always. About 70,000 years ago <a href=\"http://astronomynow.com/2015/02/18/suns-close-encounter-with-scholzsstar/\">it came screaming past the solar system</a> at about 80 kilometers per second, narrowly missing Sol by only 0.82 light-years (52,000 AU). While the stars proper only passed through the fringe of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud\">Oort Cloud</a>, their gravitation field probably perturbed every comet on this side of Sol.</p><p>Scholz's Star was <a href=\"http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32602\">within 100,000 AU of Sol for about 10,000 years</a>. Unfortunately even at its closest it would have been far too faint to see (apparent magnitude of about 11.4, about 100 times fainter than the dimmest star visible to the naked eye). However M-dwarf stars often flare, so it might have been visible for periods of minutes to hours.</p><p>Comets perturbed from the Oort cloud <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz's_star\">will require roughly 2 million years</a> to get to the inner Solar System. So you can expect a deadly hail of comets to plaster every planet in the system in about 1.93 million years.</p><p>Scholz's star passage probably did not have anything to do with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck\">Population bottleneck</a> that happened during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory\">Toba Catastrophe</a>, though both happened suspiciously at about the same time. It would be perfectly acceptable for a science fiction author to postulate a connection for the sake of their novel, since it is enough of an unbelievable coincidence that the author will have plenty of justification. Besides it might actually be true. There is a difference between \"it is flat out impossible\" and \"scientists can think of no known mechanism which could cause it.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIP_85605\">HIP 85605</a> is a star that (may be) currently 16.1 light-years from Sol. If that distance measurement is correct (<a href=\"http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/stellar_encounters/FAQ1.html#hip85605\">which is a big <em>if</em></a>) in about 350,000 years (240,000 to 470,000) it will come plowing through the solar system and wreck the place.</p><p>Its closest approach to Sol will be from 0.13 to 0.65 light-years (8,200 to 41,000 AU), passing between the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper belt. This is going to savagely perturb every single comet in the Oort cloud and every asteroid in the Kuiper belt. In less than 2 million years the barrage of comets and asteroids will make every planet and moon in the entire solar system look like it has terminal acne and Terra's biosphere will suffer the mother of all mass extinctions.</p><p>Or maybe not. The distance of 16.1 looks suspiciously close to astronomers, it would fit the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram much better if it was about 200 light-years away. The distance was determined by the Hipparcos detector, which might have been confused by glare from a nearby star. If the latter distance is the correct one, HIP 85605 will never get closer to Sol than a very safe 30 light-years, and that in a remote 2.8 million years.</p><p>What has a spectral class of K7V, a mass of 60% of Sol, a velocity of 18.8 kilometers per second, and is heading straight at us? Why, the star <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_710\">Gliese 710</a>, of course. But don't panic, it is about 19 parsecs away (62 light-years), so we won't have to worry for another 1.4 million years.</p><p>As nearly as the astronomers can calculate, Gliese 710 is not going to pass closer than about 0.88 light-year (0.27 ± 0.17 parsecs). This will send it right through the Oort cloud on the edge of the Solar System, sending a barrage of incoming comets. This will create results ranging from a mild 5% increase in cratering to extinction-level carpet bombing of every single planet and moon. Keep in mind that it will take about 2 million years for the perturbed comets to reach the inner Solar system, so the fun won't start until about 3.4 million years from now.</p><p>But the astronomers are not really sure since that is a long trajectory to calculate and they do not have much of a back trace. It is not impossible for Gliese 710 to actually penetrate the Solar system, passing within 1,000 AU of the Sun. Or even closer.</p><p>And in any event, the fact that Gliese 710 is aimed so closely at the Sun is quite suspicious. In his novel <strong>Eternal Light</strong>, author Paul McAuley suggests that the star was indeed aimed at the solar system by alien intelligences.</p><div><p>The Asteroid Mining Company followed WarnOil's lead. Iron and nickel, of course, and a few other metals, were available in plenty in Sol's asteroid belt; but a great many other highly important metals, particularly the heavier ones, were not. Wherefore the Asteroid Mining Company changed its name to Galactic Metals, Incorporated, and sent hundreds of prospectors out to explore new solar systems. These men, too — hard-muscled, hard-fighting, hard-playing hard-rock men all were rugged, rough, and tough.</p><p>They found a sun with an asteroid belt so big and so full of chunks of heavy metal that it was all but unapproachable along any radial line anywhere near the plane of the ecliptic. This sun's fourth planet, while it was Tellus-Type as to gravity, temperature, water, air, and so forth, was much richer than Earth in metals heavier than nickel. Whereupon Galactic Metals pre-empted this metalliferous planet, named it \"Galmetia\", and proceeded to stock it with metalsmen — a breed perhaps one number <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinell_scale\">Brinell</a> harder even than Elbridge Warner's oilmen.</p></div><div><p>According to Norton's Star Atlas, there have been twenty fairly bright novae between 1899 and 1936. <strong>No less than five of them have been in one small area of the sky, in the constellation Aquila.</strong> There were two in a single year (1936), and the 1918 Nova Aquila was one of the brightest ever recorded.</p><p>What's going on in this constellation? Why did 25 percent of the novae in a forty-year period appear in only 0.25 percent of the sky? <strong>Is the front line moving in our direction?</strong></p></div><p>In the image the star is hidden inside a sooty shell of gas about 84,000 AU in radius (0.4 parsec). The front edge of the shell forms the bow wake. In the image the star is moving from right to left.</p><p>The star is well on its way to becoming a white dwarf, as it blows off carbon-rich gas. Other than the fact it is moving as fast as a jack rabbit in front of a prairie fire, it is a pretty unremarkable star.</p><p>The poor innocent star had the misfortune to become an <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/CW_Leonis\">urban legend</a> sometime in 2008.</p><p>Google Sky dumped lots of astronomical data into its sky view, to make it more interesting than just looking at white specks on a black background. Since CW Leonis is pretty much invisible by ordinary light, Google opted to use a false color infrared image. This used data from the IRAS infrared space telescope, which unfortunately had severe issues when it imaged the star. The innocent star became a huge ugly multicolored blob with two long tails that were scanning artifacts (basically lens flares).</p><p>Later in 2008 some clown who was either a True Believer conspiracy theorist or a troll in search of lulz went to WikiSky and labeled the object 'Nibiru'. Well, it is a wiki after all.</p><p><a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nibiru\">Nibiru</a> is an imaginary planet that far too many credulous conspiracy theorists believe passes by Earth every 3,600 years, allowing the <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts\">ancient astronaut</a> god-like inhabitants to invade us in their flying saucers and enslave the entire human race. Thanks to that show-oaf on WikiSky throwing gasoline on the fire, to this day there are periodic outbreaks on conspiracy forums about how CW Leonis is comin' ta getcha and the end is nigh.</p><p><a href=\"#puppis\"><img src=\"images/shareIcon.png\" title=\"link for sharing\"/></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppis_A\">Puppis A</a> is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant\">remains of a supernovae</a> about 2,000 parsecs away (7,000 light-years). It blew itself to smithereens about ten-thousand years ago (though the light of the supernova didn't reach Terra until about 3,700 years ago). While it appears to be part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant\">Vela Supernova Remnant</a>, Puppis A is actually about four times farther away and being upstaged by Vela.</p><p>In the center of Puppis A is a neutron star named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RX_J0822-4300\">RX J0822-4300</a> aka \"Cosmic Cannonball\". Which should give you an idea of how fast it is going. The neutron star is flying out of the heart of the supernova <del>like a bat out of hell</del> at 1,500 kilometers per second or about 0.5% the speed of light. At that rate it will be out of the Milky Way galaxy in a mere million years or so.</p><p>Astronomers are still undecided about how RX J0822-4300 managed to get up to such hyperspeeds, they were under the impression that you needed something like a slingshot around the Sagittarius A* galactic core black hole to do that. Just sitting next to a supernova when it goes kablooey is not enough. Some muttered that perhaps RX J0822-4300 was actually a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star\">quark star</a>. Alternatively astronomers never ever say something was caused by aliens, but it might be in the back of their minds.</p><p>However a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3510\">2012 astronomical analysis</a> figured RX J0822-4300 ain't a hypervelocity star at all, they measure it at a relatively sedate 672 km/s. Which is barely possible with a supernova. Party poopers.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_104\">WR 104</a> is a Wolf-Rayet star, 2400 parsecs from Earth, and supernova candidate. Ordinarily that would be far enough away to be harmless. Unfortunately WR 104 just might be large enough to create a lethal gamma-ray burst. And there is <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/03/wr-104-a-nearby-gamma-ray-burst/\">some evidence</a> that Earth is staring straight down WR 104's gun barrel, so to speak.</p><p>Gamma ray burst emerge along a supernovae's rotational axis. Astronomers measured WR 104's axis, and were nonplussed to discover that it was pointed within 16° of Earth. Right between the eyes. Later data suggested that the axis was only pointed within 30 to 40°, but they are still not sure.</p><div><p>But ever since the first of the so-called \"beacon stars\" was discovered, at the end of the twentieth century, we have known that there were civilizations with access to energy sources incomparably greater than ours. Some of you will doubtless recall the incredulity of the astronomers — and later of the whole human race — when the first examples of cosmic engineering were detected in the Magellanic Clouds. Here were stellar structures obeying no natural laws; even now, we do not know their purpose — but we know their awesome implications. We share a universe with creatures who can juggle with the very stars.</p></div><div><p>In a 1960 paper Dyson suggested that any really advanced civilisation could not allow its sun to squander all its energy into space, but would eventually surround it by a shell — not necessarily a continuous one, but a cloud of orbiting worldlets. These \"Dyson spheres\" could be detected by their infra-red radiations, and several searches have been made for such artefacts. Though they have so far been unsuccessful, perhaps the first evidence of extra-terrestrial civilisations would be not through radio signals but by the detection of similar examples of cosmic engineering. However, like ants crawling round the base of the Empire State Building, we might not recognise it . . .</p><p>A short pause while I release another bee from my bonnet. The cover of the February/March 1997 Astronomy and Geophysics, the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society carries a dramatic and thought-provoking illustration — a radio image of the gas-clouds expanding from the galaxy 3C 123.

But as that mass builds and builds doesn’t the event horizon move?  Take the scene to the limit.  Say a black hole never absorbs anything.  The amount of mass parked just above the horizon becomes so great that another black hole forms. Now you have two overlapping horizons, which can’t stay that way. What really happens is that the density of mass inside the radius near the black hole is sufficient to be a black hole of a larger diameter and then it just... is.<p>I think that what this means is that you never get to the event horizon, but the horizon comes to you.","parent":16453560,"id":16454696,"by":"hinkley"},{"type":"comment","time":1519501323,"text":"If you&#x27;ve not come across Lee Smolin&#x27;s (speculative) writing on the Fecund Universes theory, you&#x27;ll probably also love it.

From January to August 2017, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services sent 85,265 requests for evidence in response to H-1B visa applications, a 45 percent increase compared to the same period a year earlier, agency data show. Such requests are made when an application is missing required documents or when the agency determines it needs more proof to decide if a worker is eligible for the visa.

Recent works have relied on volumetricor point cloud representations, but such approaches suffer from a number ofissues such as computational complexity, unordered data, and lack of finergeometry. This paper demonstrates that a mesh representation (i.e. vertices andfaces to form polygonal surfaces) is able to capture fine-grained geometry for3D reconstruction tasks. A mesh however is also unstructured data similar topoint clouds. We address this problem by proposing a learning framework toinfer the parameters of a compact mesh representation rather than learning fromthe mesh itself. This compact representation encodes a mesh using free-formdeformation and a sparse linear combination of models allowing us toreconstruct 3D meshes from single images. In contrast to prior work, we do notrely on silhouettes and landmarks to perform 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ourmethod on synthetic and real-world datasets with very promising results. Ourframework efficiently reconstructs 3D objects in a low-dimensional way whilepreserving its important geometrical aspects.</blockquote><div><h2>Submission history</h2>From: Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/show-email/cf64e672/1711.10669\">view email</a>]<br/><b>[v1]</b> Wed, 29 Nov 2017 03:57:32 GMT (9452kb,D)<br/></div><div><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/auth/show-endorsers/1711.10669\">Which authors of this paper are endorsers?</a> | <a id=\"mathjax_toggle\" href=\"javascript:setMathjaxCookie()\">Disable MathJax</a> (<a href=\"/help/mathjax/\">What is MathJax?</a>)</div></div></div>","score":32,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519493892,"text":"No source code :(","parent":16454117,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519495679,"text":"Right, they probably just made it all up.","parent":16454302,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519499576,"text":"No, but independent third party verification is a cornerstone of science.<p>I read many many deep learning papers and very often there are cherry picked results OR poor validation methods.

I wanted to do this with Open Source tools and use the calibration data for my Linux desktop, so I ordered a ColorHug2 colorimeter, which is Open Hardware compliant and all the tools are FOSS licensed. And from then on everything just went downhill.</p><p>The ColorHug2 comes with a small USB storage key which is supposed to contain a Fedora Live Session environment with all the tools to calibrate the display. The created ICC color profiles can then also be used on other devices (even on Windows and MacOS). Except that both my laptop and PC refused to even offer the key as a bootable device (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/colorhug-users/gJZ2UbQTmc4\">which seems to be a known issue</a>). Well, it uses the DisplayCAL GUI frontend for ArgyllCMS anyways, and both these packages are in the repositories of any modern Linux distribution. I had already used them two years ago to calibrate some devices at work, so I put the USB key aside, installed DisplayCAL on my devices, set up the ColorHug2, and started calibration runs. Only to see ArgyllCMS fail every time time because the USB connection to the ColorHug2 kept failing after a while, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/colorhug-users/Dssu1xKTYvM\">which also seems to be a known issue</a>. Grunt. This is absolutely not what I expect when I invest more than 100 € in an Open Hardware device.</p><p>The known workaround for the problem seems to be an additional USB reset after the device is released (pointing to a firmware bug in the ColorHug2), which is contained in the very latest ArgyllCMS 2.0.1 beta development soure code. So I downloaded, built and installed it, and the calibration finally ran through. But before the calibration starts, DisplayCAL shows an interactive display adjustment screen to have you prepare the display as good as possible before the actual calibration starts. A work colleague lent me his Pantone huey colorimeter, which also works with ArgyllCMS. My photo editing monitor at home is a BenQ BL2711U, which is sold as a professional 4K CAD Monitor, has 100% sRGB color space coverage and is known to have very good color representation even on factory defaults. So I expected both the huey and the ColorHug2 to see just minor deviations, and the measurements to be consistent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1970\"><a href=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/linux-color-management-broken-whitebalance.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/linux-color-management-broken-whitebalance.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/linux-color-management-broken-whitebalance.jpg 481w, http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/linux-color-management-broken-whitebalance-300x278.jpg 300w\"/></a><figcaption>The DisplayCAL interactive display adjustment screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Which was absolutely not the case. The dialogue shows the distribution between the three color channels, and if the display has the necessary controls (laptops don’t), you correct until all three channels meet in the middle. With the huey, AryllCMS detected a very slight green tint with the factory settings, which I corrected by lowering the Green channel from 100 to 99 in the monitor settings. The ColorHug2 measured a non-existing very heavy green tint, and I had to lower the Green channel from 100 to 80 to make the bars meet. At that point the whole display had become a quite heavy purple (the Blue and Red channels being way overblown in comparison to Green), which definitely wasn’t right. So I gave up on the ColorHug2 for the moment and continued with the huey, but there are some indications that <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/colorhug-users/PFycMgsKCr0\">this might be another ColorHug2 issue</a>. (I later found out that there is a firmware update to version 2.0.7 for the ColorHug2, which only seems to be available via the <code>fwupd</code> tool, but not via the <code>colorhug-tools</code> or from the repository where all the other releases can be found. I haven’t tried this update yet.)</p><p>DisplayCAL/ArgyllCMS gave me a good profile using the huey and confirmed that the BL2711U actually exceeds the advertised 100% sRGB coverage. The difference between using the calibration data and not using it was barely noticeable. Now I wanted to have the system and every application use my generated profile. Turns out the XFCE desktop I use simply doesn’t have any color management, like most other “smaller” FOSS desktop environments. You can use a tool like <code>dispwin</code> to manually write the correction values into the video look-up table (VideoLUT) of the graphics card, but the applications also have to know about the profile so they can account for it, e.g. when converting between color spaces (every browser has to do this). And this is where it gets really complicated: This is Linux, so there are no rules or standards.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1975\"><a href=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-source-color-management-broken-kde.png.85.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-source-color-management-broken-kde.png.85.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-source-color-management-broken-kde.png.85.jpg 732w, http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-source-color-management-broken-kde.png.85-300x211.jpg 300w\"/></a><figcaption>An example of the KDE color management settings screen provided by colord-kde.</figcaption></figure><p>There are multiple ways to tell an application about the current profile. There is <code>colord</code>, a daemon which can create, store and manage calibration profiles and sensors and offers its services via D-Bus. And there is the <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code> X11 atom, which allows applications to attach profiles to and query profiles from X.Org display outputs. Ideally <code>colord</code> would do everything, but it runs in the background and doesn’t have access to the running X session, so it needs helpers. GNOME and KDE Plasma have GUI frontends for this, and both <code>kded</code> and <code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> have plugins for setting the <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code> X11 atom. Except that they only set it for the primary output. Turns out if you have multiple displays, the profile for the first one is put into the <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code> X11 atom, but the profile for the second one in the <code>_ICC_PROFILE_1</code> X11 atom, for the third display in the <code>_ICC_PROFILE_2</code> X11 atom, and so on. It’s just that nobody seems to do this.</p><p>That means your profiles might actually be written into the VideoLUTs of the respective outputs, but every application which relies on the <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code> X11 atoms will only be able to get the profile for the primary display. darktable pretty much seems to be the only clever one out there, because it supports both <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code> and <code>colord</code> and also supplies the excellent <code>darktable-cmstest</code> tool which can be used to check which setting is currently set to which value.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1969\"><a href=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bildschirmfoto-von-»2018-02-24-10-28-26«.png.85.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bildschirmfoto-von-»2018-02-24-10-28-26«.png.85.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bildschirmfoto-von-»2018-02-24-10-28-26«.png.85.jpg 924w, http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bildschirmfoto-von-»2018-02-24-10-28-26«.png.85-300x110.jpg 300w, http://www.lieberbiber.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bildschirmfoto-von-»2018-02-24-10-28-26«.png.85-768x282.jpg 768w\"/></a><figcaption>Example output of the darktable-cmstest tool while running under GNOME Shell. Notice that _ICC_PROFILE_1 and _ICC_PROFILE_2 are not set, while colord knows the correct profiles for all displays.</figcaption></figure><p>But it gets even worse. GNOME (and Ubuntu Unity, which borrows most of its tools) at least has color management built into the desktop environment by default. KDE Plasma offers <code>kde-colord</code>, but it’s an optional package, and for example in Ubuntu 18.04 it is four years old, two releases behind and doesn’t work because it seems to <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/amd64/colord-kde/filelist\">still assume we live in a KDE 4 world</a>.  If you use KDE Plasma on Ubuntu today, you can’t even have color management. All in all this is probably why many developers, if they even care about color management, just give up and let the user set the profile manually. This at least seems to be true for GIMP, PhotoFlow and RawTherapee. Firefox by default only does color management for tagged images. Chrome/Chromium, Gwenview and digiKam seem to use <code>_ICC_PROFILE</code>, but probably only for the first display as well.</p><p>So these are my current suggestions for color management on Linux:</p><ul><li>Make sure you really need and want it. As I’ve written the factory settings of a good monitor can be quite good already.</li><li>Make sure the applications you need color management for know what color management is. Most don’t.</li><li>Only use one display, or make sure you can live with having color management on just the primary one.</li><li>Use GNOME Shell or Ubuntu Unity with X.Org. I don’t think Wayland even has a specification on how to do color management.</li><li>If you really want KDE Plasma, make sure <code>colord-kde</code> works. It is broken on Ubuntu 18.04, but works fine on Arch.</li><li>Find someone who lends you a working, professional-grade calibration device supported by ArgyllCMS (it supports many) before you spend more than 100 € on something just because it has an Open Hardware sticker.</li></ul></div></div>","score":90,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519503128,"text":"It&#x27;s unclear to me why there&#x27;s no color palette&#x2F;correction table exposed in libdrm&#x2F;KMS at the kernel.

We had originally planned a trip away with my parents and some friends from southern California, but they all fell through -- my father was diagnosed with cancer late in 2017 and their trip to visit us in the U.S. was cancelled, and our friends work in medicine and wound up being on call. One of Lou's other friends came to visit us, instead: she was on a mission to experience midnight twice on January 1st by flying from Hong Kong to San Francisco. That might sound like an excuse to party hard, but instead we sat around an Ikea table playing board games, drinking wine and eating gingerbread. It was very pleasant.</p><p>On Monday (the 1st) I had the day off work for New Year's day, as is usual in most of the western world, so I slept in late. Lou and her friend decided to go to the wax museum and see several tourist attractions around SF, and I decided to pass the day at home reading. That afternoon, work chat started talking about a <a href=\"http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/169166980422/the-mysterious-case-of-the-linux-page-table\">Tumblr post by <code>pythonsweetness</code></a> about an Intel hardware security bug. At the time I definitely did not suspect that this was going to occupy most of my working life for the next (almost) two months.</p><p>Like many people who work on system security, I had read Anders Fogh's post about a <a href=\"https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/\">\"Negative Result\"</a> in speculative execution research in July of 2017. At the time I thought it was an interesting writeup and I remember being glad that researchers were looking into this area. I sent the post to Bryan and asked him about his thoughts on it at the time, to which he replied saying that \"it would be shocking if they left a way to directly leak out memory in the speculative execution\". None of us seriously thought that there would be low-hanging fruit down that research path, but we also felt it was important that there was someone doing work in the area who was committed to public disclosure.</p><p>At first, after reading the blog post on Monday, we thought (or hoped) that the bug might \"just\" be a KASLR bypass and wouldn't require a lot of urgency. We tried to reach out to Intel at work to get more information but were met with silence. (We wouldn't hear back from them until after the disclosure was already made public.) The <em>speculation</em> on Tuesday intensified, until finally on Wednesday morning I arrived at the office to find links to late Tuesday night tweets revealing exploits that allowed arbitrary kernel memory reads.</p><p>Wednesday was not a happy day. Intel finally responded to our emails -- after they had already initiated public disclosure. I found a bottle of scotch on a shelf in the corner and had a glass or two in the afternoon once the papers were out. We all spent a lot of time reading. An arbitrary kernel memory read (an info leak) is not that uncommon as far as bugs go, but for the most part they tend to be fairly easy to fix. The thing that makes the Meltdown and Spectre bugs particularly notable is that in order to mitigate them, a large amount of change is required in very deep low-level parts of the kernel. The kind of deep parts of the kernel where there are 20-year old errata workarounds that were single-line changes that you have to be very careful to not accidentally undo; the kind of parts where, as they say, mortals fear to tread.</p><p>On Friday we saw the patches Matthew Dillon put together for DragonFlyBSD for the first time. These were the first patches for KPTI that were very straightforward to read and understand, and applied to a BSD-derived kernel that was similar to those I'm accustomed to working on.</p><p>To mitigate Meltdown (and partially one of the Spectre variants), you have to make sure that speculative execution cannot reach any sensitive data from a user context. This basically means that the pages the kernel uses for anything potentially sensitive have to be unmapped when we are running user code. Traditionally, CPUs that were built to run a multi-user, UNIX-like OS did this by default (SPARC is an example of such a CPU which has completely separate address spaces for the kernel and userland). However, x86 descends from a single-address-space microcontroller that has grown up avoiding backwards-incompatible changes, and has never really introduced a clean notion of multiple address spaces (segmentation is the closest feature really, and it was thrown out for 64-bit AMD64). Instead, operating systems for x86 have generally wound up (at least in the post-AMD64 era) with flat address space models where the kernel text and data is always present in the page table no matter whether you're in user or kernel mode. The kernel mappings simply have the \"supervisor\" bit set on them so that user code can't directly access them.</p><p>The mitigation is basically to stop doing this: to stop mapping the kernel text, data and other memory into the page table while we're running in userland. Unfortunately, the x86 design does not make this easy. In order to be able to take interrupts or traps, the CPU has to have a number of structures mapped in the current page table at all times (the IDT, GDT and TSS, as well as any LDTs if you're using those). There is also no ability to tell an x86 CPU that you want it to switch page tables when an interrupt occurs. So, the code that we jump to when we take an interrupt, as well as space for a stack to push context onto have to be available in both page tables. And finally, of course, we need to be able to figure out somehow what the other page table we should switch to is when we enter the kernel.</p><p>When we looked at the patches for Linux (and also the DragonFlyBSD patches at the time) on Friday and started asking questions, it became pretty evident that the initial work done by both was done under time constraints. Both had left the full kernel text mapped in both page tables, and the Linux trampoline design seemed over-complex. I started talking over some ideas with Robert Mustacchi about ways to fix these and who we should talk to, and reached out to some of my old workmates from UQ who were involved with OpenBSD. It seemed to me that the OpenBSD developers would care about these issues even more than we did, and would want to work out how to do the mitigation right.</p><p>I ended up sending an email to Philip Guenther on Friday afternoon, and on Saturday morning I drove an hour or so to meet up with him for coffee to talk page tables and interrupt trampolines. We wound up spending a good 6 hours at the coffee shop, and I came back with several pages of notes and a half-decent idea of the shape of the work to come.</p><p>One detail we missed that day was the interaction of per-CPU structures with per-process page tables. Much of the interrupt trampoline work is most easily done by using per-CPU structures in memory (and you definitely want a per-CPU stack!). If you combine that with per-process page tables, however, you have a problem: if you leave all the per-CPU areas mapped in all the processes, you will leak information (via Meltdown) about the state of one process to a different one when taking interrupts. In particular, you will leak things like <code>%rip</code>, which ruins all the work being done with PIE and ASLR pretty quickly. So, there are two options: you can either allocate the per-CPU structures per-process (so you end up with <code>$NCPUS * $NPROCS</code> of them); or you can make the page tables per-CPU.</p><p>OpenBSD, like Linux and the other implementations so far, decided to go down the road of per-CPU per-process pages to solve this issue. For illumos, we took the other route.</p><p>In illumos, it turned out that we already had per-CPU page tables. Robert and I re-discovered this on the Sunday of that week, sitting around the same Ikea table I played board games on the week before for New Year's. We use them for 32-bit processes due to having full P>V PAE support in our kernel (which is, as it turns out, relatively uncommon amongst open-source OS). The logic to deal with creating and managing them and updating them was all already written, and after reading the code we concluded we could basically make a few small changes and re-use all of it. So we did.</p><p>By the end of that second week, we had a prototype that could get to userland. But, when working on this kind of kernel change we have a rule of thumb we use: after the first 70% of the patch is done and we can boot again, now it's time for the second 70%. In fact it turned out to be more like the second 200% for us -- a tedious long tail of bugs to solve that ended up necessitating some changes in the design as well.</p><p>At first we borrowed the method that Matt Dillon used for DragonFlyBSD, by putting the temporary \"stack\" space and state data for the interrupt trampolines into an extra page tacked onto the end of <code>*%gs</code> (in illumos the structure that lives there is the <code>cpu_t</code>). We would check for kernel <code>%cs</code> and then <code>swapgs</code> when entering the trampolines and use <code>%gs</code>-relative addressing to find the structure members.</p><p>If you read the existing logic in interrupt handlers for dealing with <code>%gs</code> though, you will quickly notice that the corner cases start to build up. There are a bunch of situations where the kernel temporarily alters <code>%gs</code>, and some of the ways to mess it up have security consequences that end up being worse than the bug we're trying to fix. As it turns out, there are no less than 3 different ways that ISRs use to try to get to having the right <code>cpu_t</code> in <code>%gs</code> on illumos, as it turns out, and they are all subtly different. Trying to tell which you should use when requires a bunch of test logic that in turn requires branches and changes to the CPU state, which is difficult to do in a trampoline where you're trying to avoid altering that state as much as possible until you've got the real stack online to push things into.</p><p>I kept in touch with Philip Guenther and Mike Larkin from the OpenBSD project throughout the weeks that followed. In one of the discussions we had, we talked about the NMI/MCE handlers and the fact that their handling currently on OpenBSD neglected some nasty corner-cases around interrupting an existing trap handler. A big part of the solution to those issues was to use a feature called IST, which allows you to unconditionally change stacks when you take an interrupt.</p><p>Traditionally, x86 only changes the stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code> on AMD64) while taking an interrupt when there is a privilege level change. If you take an interrupt while already in the kernel, the CPU does not change the stack pointer, and simply pushes the interrupt stack frame onto the stack you're already using. IST makes the change of stack pointer unconditional. If used unwisely, this is a bad idea: if you stay on that stack and turn interrupts back on, you could take another interrupt and clobber the frame you're already in. However, in it I saw a possible way to simplify the KPTI trampoline logic and avoid having to deal with <code>%gs</code>.</p><p>A few weeks into the project, John Levon joined us at work. He had previously worked on a bunch of Xen-related stuff as well as other parts of the kernel very close to where we were, so he quickly got up to speed with the KPTI work as well. He and I drafted out a \"crazy idea\" on the whiteboard one afternoon where we would use IST for <em>all</em> interrupts on the system, and put the \"stack\" they used in the KPTI page on the end of the <code>cpu_t</code>. Then, they could easily use stack-relative addresses to get the page table to change to, then pivot their stack to the real kernel stack memory, and throw away (almost) all the conditional logic. A few days later, we had convinced each other that this was the way to go.</p><p>Two of the most annoying x86 issues we had to work around were related to the <code>SYSENTER</code> instruction. This instruction is used to make \"fast\" system calls in 32-bit userland. It has a couple of unfortunate properties: firstly, it doesn't save or restore RFLAGS, so the kernel code has to take care of this (and be very careful not to clobber any of it before saving or after restoring it). Secondly, if you execute <code>SYSENTER</code> with the <code>TF</code> (\"trap\"/single-step flag) set by a debugger, the resulting debug trap's frame points at kernel code instead of the user code where it actually happened. The first one requires some careful gymnastics on the entry and return trampolines specifically for <code>SYSENTER</code>, while the second is a nasty case that is incidentally made easier by using IST. With IST, we can simply make the debug trap trampoline check for whether we took the trap in another trampoline's code, and reset <code>%cr3</code> and the destination stack. This works for single-stepping into any of the handlers, not just the one for <code>SYSENTER</code>.</p><p>To make debugging easier, we decided that traps like the debug/single-step trap (as well as faults like page faults, <code>#GP</code>, etc.) would push their interrupt frame in a different part of the KPTI state page to normal interrupts. We applied this change to all the traps that can interrupt another trampoline (based on the instructions we used). These \"paranoid\" traps also set a flag in the KPTI struct to mark it busy (and jump to the double-fault handler if it is), to work around some bugs where double-faults are not correctly generated.</p><p>It's been a long and busy two months, with lots of time spent building, testing, and validating the code. We've run it on as many kinds of machines as we could get our hands on, to try to make sure we catch issues. The time we've spent on this has been validated several times in the process by finding bugs that could have been nasty in production.</p><p>One great example: our patches on Westmere-EP Xeons were causing busy machines to throw a lot of L0 I-cache parity errors. This seemed very mysterious at first, and it took us a few times seeing it to believe that it was actually our fault. This was actually caused by the accidental activation of a CPU errata for Westmere (B52, \"Memory Aliasing of Code Pages May Cause Unpredictable System Behaviour\") -- it turned out we had made a typo and put the \"cacheable\" flag into a variable named <code>flags</code> instead of <code>attrs</code> where it belonged when setting up the page tables. This was causing performance degradation on other machines, but on Westmere it causes cache parity errors as well. This is a great example of the surprising consequences that small mistakes in this kind of code can end up having. In the end, I'm glad that that erratum existed, othertise it may have been a long time before we caught that bug.</p><p>As of this week, Mike and Philip have committed the OpenBSD patches for KPTI <a href=\"https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=151924107018358&w=2\">to their repository</a>, and the patches for illumos are out for review. It's a nice kind of symmetry that the two projects who started on the work together after the public disclosure at the same time are both almost ready to ship at the same time at the other end. I'm feeling hopeful, and looking forward to further future collaborations like this with our cousins, the BSDs.</p></div></div>","score":64,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519492237,"text":"<i>segmentation is the closest feature really, and it was thrown out for 64-bit AMD64</i><p>That was one of the &quot;big things&quot; with the 286 and protected mode, and enhanced even further with the 386, so it&#x27;s a bit ironic and sad that it can&#x27;t be done in 64-bit mode --- and I&#x27;m sure it could be done in a backwards-compatible manner if AMD chose to (double-wide descriptors seem to be a reasonably popular thought), but it feels like a lot of the decisions made with AMD64 were more just to spite Intel than benefit anything or anyone else.<p>Related: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;?p=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;?p=25</a>","parent":16453502,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519496698,"text":"It&#x27;s not so insidious as you suggest (from your link):<p><i>VMware chose not to support 64 bit virtualization until AMD reintroduced (optional) segment limits on later models of their Opteron and Athlon 64 CPUs.

It&#x27;s only now that we realize without those you can trick a processor into fetching memory it shouldn&#x27;t and that the only viable software solution has been to effectively implement separate page tables and enforce copying between their stack contexts at the user&#x2F;kernel boundary anyway (so we&#x27;re back where we started with slow context switches).<p>In theory, you could mitigate specter by running every process in its own hardware virtualized address space, right? It&#x27;s just much more complicated to do that because you&#x27;d need to move the kernel to the hypervisor ring or rewrite everything to communicate entirely using a shared physical resource like a network interface. If VT-x allowed shared memory regions with ownership restrictions (does it?) you wouldn&#x27;t even need to do that.","parent":16454153,"id":16454525,"by":"dcow"}],"id":16454153,"by":"userbinator"}],"id":16453502,"descendants":2,"by":"bcantrill"},{"url":"https://kactus.io/","type":"story","title":"Kactus: Design version control without changing tools","time":1519490449,"summary":"<div><div><span><svg><path></path></svg></span><h2>Experience Git</h2><p>Enjoy all the benefits of git with our simple UI, leaving you more time to focus on what matters — your design.</p></div><div><span><svg><g><path></path><path></path><path></path><path></path><path></path><path></path><path></path><path></path></g></svg></span><h2>Streamline your workflow</h2><p>Create branches, collaborate with other designers or developers, and commit changes without touching the command line.</p></div></div>","score":29,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519501449,"text":"I’ve seen multiple version control apps pass by in recent years.

Until now, such keys have always been stored in the United States, meaning that any government or law enforcement authority seeking access to a Chinese iCloud account needed to go through the U.S. legal system. </p><p>Now, according to Apple, for the first time the company will store the keys for Chinese iCloud accounts in China itself. That means Chinese authorities will no longer have to use the U.S. courts to seek information on iCloud users and can instead use their own legal system to ask Apple to hand over iCloud data for Chinese users, legal experts said. </p><p>Human rights activists say they fear the authorities could use that power to track down dissidents, citing cases from more than a decade ago in which Yahoo Inc handed over user data that led to arrests and prison sentences for two democracy advocates.  Jing Zhao, a human rights activist and Apple shareholder, said he could envisage worse human rights issues arising from Apple handing over iCloud data than occurred in the Yahoo case. </p><p>In a statement, Apple said it had to comply with recently introduced Chinese laws that require cloud services offered to Chinese citizens be operated by Chinese companies and that the data be stored in China. It said that while the company’s values don’t change in different parts of the world, it is subject to each country’s laws. </p><p>“While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful,” it said. Apple said it decided it was better to offer iCloud under the new system because discontinuing it would lead to a bad user experience and actually lead to less data privacy and security for its Chinese customers. </p><p>As a result, Apple has established a data center for Chinese users in a joint venture with state-owned firm Guizhou - Cloud Big Data Industry Co Ltd. The firm was set up and funded by the provincial government in the relatively poor southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou in 2014. The Guizhou company has close ties to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>The Apple decision highlights a difficult reality for many U.S. technology companies operating in China. If they don’t accept demands to partner with Chinese companies and store data in China then they risk losing access to the lucrative Chinese market, despite fears about trade secret theft and the rights of Chinese customers. </p><h3>     BROAD POWERS </h3><p>Apple says the joint venture does not mean that China has any kind of “backdoor” into user data and that Apple alone – not its Chinese partner – will control the encryption keys.  But Chinese customers will notice some differences from the start: their iCloud accounts will now be co-branded with the name of the local partner, a first for Apple. </p><p>And even though Chinese iPhones will retain the security features that can make it all but impossible for anyone, even Apple, to get access to the phone itself, that will not apply to the iCloud accounts. Any information in the iCloud account could be accessible to Chinese authorities who can present Apple with a legal order. </p><p>Apple said it will only respond to valid legal requests in China, but China’s domestic legal process is very different than that in the U.S., lacking anything quite like an American “warrant” reviewed by an independent court, Chinese legal experts said. Court approval isn’t required under Chinese law and police can issue and execute warrants. </p><p>“Even very early in a criminal investigation, police have broad powers to collect evidence,” said Jeremy Daum, an attorney and research fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center in Beijing.  “(They are) authorized by internal police procedures rather than independent court review, and the public has an obligation to cooperate.” </p><p>    Guizhou - Cloud Big Data and China’s cyber and industry regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Guizhou provincial government said it had no specific comment. </p><p>There are few penalties for breaking what rules do exist around obtaining warrants in China. And while China does have data privacy laws, there are broad exceptions when authorities investigate criminal acts, which can include undermining communist values, “picking quarrels” online, or even using a virtual private network to browse the Internet privately. </p><p>Apple says the cryptographic keys stored in China will be specific to the data of Chinese customers, meaning Chinese authorities can’t ask Apple to use them to decrypt data in other countries like the United States. </p><p>Privacy lawyers say the changes represent a big downgrade in protections for Chinese customers. </p><p>    “The U.S. standard, when it’s a warrant and when it’s properly executed, is the most privacy-protecting standard,” said Camille Fischer of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </p><h3>WARNED CUSTOMERS </h3><p>Apple has given its Chinese users notifications about the Feb. 28 switchover data to the Chinese data center in the form of emailed warnings and so-called push alerts, reminding users that they can chose to opt out of iCloud and store information solely on their device. The change only affects users who set China as their country on Apple devices and doesn’t affect users who select Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. </p><p>The default settings on the iPhone will automatically create an iCloud back-up when a phone is activated. Apple declined to comment on whether it would change its default settings to make iCloud an opt-in service, rather than opt-out, for Chinese users. </p><p>Apple said it will not switch customers’ accounts to the Chinese data center until they agree to new terms of service and that more than 99.9 percent of current users have already done so. </p><p>Until now, Apple appears to have handed over very little data about Chinese users. From mid-2013 to mid-2017, Apple said it did not give customer account content to Chinese authorities, despite having received 176 requests, according to transparency reports published by the company. By contrast, Apple has given the United States customer account content in response to 2,366 out of 8,475 government requests. </p><p>Those figures are from before the Chinese cyber security laws took effect and also don’t include special national security requests in which U.S. officials might have requested data about Chinese nationals. Apple, along with other companies, is prevented by law from disclosing the targets of those requests. </p><p>Apple said requests for data from the new Chinese datacentre will be reflected in its transparency reports and that it won’t respond to “bulk” data requests. </p><p>Human rights activists say they are also concerned about such a close relationship with a state-controlled entity like Guizhou-Cloud Big Data. </p><p>Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, said the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure Apple through a committee of members it will have within the company. These committees have been pushing for more influence over decision making within foreign-invested companies in the past couple of years. </p><h3>    </h3><div><div><p>Reporting by Stephen NellisEditing by Jonathan Weber and Martin Howell</p></div></div><div><span>Our Standards:</span><span><a href=\"http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html\">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></span></div></div></div>","score":54,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519498241,"text":"To Apple&#x27;s credit there are still significant parts of their platform that remain end-to-end encrypted even in China -- meaning that Apple or any other cloud operator can&#x27;t read because they don&#x27;t have the keys, notably:[1]<p>- iMessage<p>- Keychain<p>- Siri data<p>And more like health, home &amp; payments.<p>While it&#x27;s unfortunate that Apple couldn&#x27;t compel China to run their government requests for data through the U.S. court system, in my view it is pretty amazing that they are &quot;getting away&quot; with keeping the most sensitive data end-to-end encrypted.<p>I mean China shut down WhatsApp last year and iMessage is of a similar level of security.[2] Then again nobody really uses iMessage in China.

Being a Linux user requires me to run this in <a href=\"https://winehq.org\">Wine</a>, a Windows API translation layer. While Wine is continuously improving, its performance in Direct3D games still leaves much to be desired.</p><p>Having very little familiarity with Direct3D or the Wine codebase, I decided to spend a weekend diving straight into the deep end to make things better.</p><h2 id=\"finding-the-bottleneck\">Finding the bottleneck</h2><p>We have a bit of a head start regarding where to look- since the game runs well on Windows, we know that our bottleneck is likely to be CPU-side or synchronization related (either in NVIDIA’s GL driver, or in wine). Using tools such as <code>nvidia-smi</code> reveals that our GPU utilization is fairly low (30-40%), which reaffirms my suspicions.</p><p>But before touching a single line of code, we need visibility. What problem are we trying to solve? Where is the slowness coming from?</p><p>One of my favourite tools for answering these questions is <a href=\"https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page\">perf</a>, a performance counter based profiler for Linux. <code>perf</code> gives us insight into what the distribution of CPU time is- importantly, which functions are the hottest.</p><p>That’s all we need to get started here. I opened WoW and traveled to an area of the game that performed much worse under Wine- running at ~14fps, versus ~40fps in Windows. <code>perf</code> sheds a light into where our time was spent:</p><div><img src=\"../images/wine-pba-vanilla-perf-top.png\" alt=\"The output of perf top while running WoW.\"/><p>The output of <code>perf top</code> while running WoW.</p></div><p>Let’s analyze some of the top offenders, and figure out at a high level how to make things better.</p><p>Firstly, <strong><code>wined3d_cs_run</code></strong> leads us head first into how Wine’s Direct3D implementation works internally. <code>wined3d</code> is the library responsible for translating Direct3D calls into OpenGL calls. Newer versions of wine use a <strong>command stream</strong> to execute the OpenGL calls after translation from their D3D equivalents. Think of this as a separate thread that executes a queue of draw commands and state updates from other threads. This not only solves the issue of the multithreaded OpenGL story being nightmarish, but lets us parallelize more effectively and ensures that the resulting GL calls are executed in some serialized ordering.</p><p>Right, back to <code>wined3d_cs_run</code>. This is the core of the command stream- it’s just a function that busy-waits on a queue for commands from other threads. Some brief analysis of the source code indicates that it does no real work of interest, other than invoke op handlers for the various commands. But at least we know about command streams now!</p><p><strong><code>wined3d_resource_map</code></strong> is where things get interesting. Fundamentally, it’s a function that maps a slice of GPU memory into the host’s address space, typically for streaming geometry data or texture uploads. Given a “resource” (which is typically just a handle into some kind of GPU memory), it does the following;</p><ol><li>Waits for the resource to no longer be held by any other command in the command stream.</li><li>Adds an operation to the command stream to map a section of the given resource into the host’s address space.<ul><li>For resources backed by GL buffers, this is accomplished using <code>glMapBufferRange</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Waits on a response from the command stream thread, containing a pointer to the address.</li></ol><p>Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense. We need to wait for the command stream to finish before this function can return- otherwise, where would we get our pointer from? We can’t execute any OpenGL commands to map the resource off the command thread, so we’re forced to wait.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-up-against\">What we’re up against</h2><p>I needed to learn more about how WoW uses its buffer maps to figure out what we could do here.</p><p>Enter <a href=\"https://apitrace.github.io/\">apitrace</a>. By using <code>apitrace</code> to wrap the execution of WoW under wine, I could intercept the D3D9 calls it was making prior to hitting <code>wined3d</code>.</p><div><img src=\"../images/wine-pba-d3d9-apitrace.png\" alt=\"Some apitrace buffer locking goodness.\"/><p>Some apitrace buffer locking goodness.</p></div><p>Using this data, I was able to construct a simple model of how WoW renders dynamic geometry;</p><ol><li>Lock (map) vertex and index buffers with the <code>D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE</code> flag, which promises not to overwrite any data involved in an in-flight draw call.<ul><li>This allows the GPU to avoid waiting for the prior draw call to finish before returning the buffer.</li><li>If a buffer is full, map it with the <code>D3DLOCK_DISCARD</code> flag, which invalidates the buffer’s contents.<ul><li>This can either assign the buffer to a new, unused location, or do nothing at all if the buffer is not being used for any draw calls.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Copy vertex data into the newly mapped region using <code>memcpy</code>.</li><li>Unlock the buffers.</li><li>Execute <code>DrawIndexedPrimitive</code> on the new segment of vertex data in the buffer.</li><li>Repeat back to 1, moving your offset further into the buffer.</li></ol><p>This technique works very well for ensuring that we should never have to wait for the GPU. <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb147263(v=vs.85).aspx#Using_Dynamic_Vertex_and_Index_Buffers\">In fact, Microsoft recommends it</a>.</p><p>But, the story with wine is less than ideal.

By waiting for the command stream thread and the mapping thread to synchronize, we’re wasting time that could instead be spent dispatching more draw calls to the GPU. If the command stream thread is busy, the D3D thread could be waiting a nontrivial amount of time for a response! Not only this, but <code>glMapBufferRange</code>- the actual OpenGL call used to map a buffer- is <strong>slow</strong>. Actually mapping the buffers, even when synchronization is explicitly disabled, takes a long time.</p><h2 id=\"cease-and-persist\">Cease and persist</h2><p>We could solve our problem handily by not having to wait for the CS thread. The question is- how?</p><p><strong>Suppose we had access to a large, persistently mapped buffer in the host address space. We never had to unmap it to make a draw call, and writes to it were coherently visible to the GPU without any GL calls.</strong></p><ul><li>If the flag <code>D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE</code> was provided, then we can return the address of the last persistent mapping for that buffer.<ul><li><em>Just pointer arithmetic- no need to talk to the command stream thread!</em></li><li><em><code>D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE</code> fundamentally lets us ignore synchronization.</em></li></ul></li><li>If the flag <code>D3DLOCK_DISCARD</code> was provided, then we can remap the buffer to an unused section of persistently mapped GPU memory.<ul><li><em>A bit trickier to implement- we’ll need an allocator in order to avoid fragmentation.</em></li></ul></li><li>Otherwise, we need to wait for the GPU to finish using the buffer (i.e. talk to the command stream thread).<ul><li><em>This is fine for our purposes, since this (common) streaming geometry technique doesn’t need to wait for buffers.</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>Enter the holy grail: <code>ARB_buffer_storage</code>. This lets us allocate an immutable section of GPU memory, and allow persistent (always mapped) and coherent (write-through) maps of it. We’re effectively replacing the role of the driver here, which would handle <code>DISCARD</code> (<code>INVALIDATE</code> in GL) and <code>NOOVERWRITE</code> (<code>UNSYNCHRONIZED</code> in GL) buffer maps itself.</p><p><em>This is an AZDO (approaching zero driver overhead) style GL extension. If you’re interested, check out <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-vulkan\">this article by NVIDIA</a>.</em></p><h2 id=\"introducing-wine-pba\">Introducing wine-pba</h2><p><code>wine-pba</code> (short for persistent buffer allocator) is a set of patches I’ve written that leverages <code>ARB_buffer_storage</code> to implement a GL-free GPU heap allocator, vastly improving the speed of buffer maps.</p><p>At device initialization, a very large OpenGL buffer is allocated. This buffer is governed by a simple re-entrant heap allocator that allows both the command stream thread and D3D thread to make allocations and recycle them independently from each other.</p><p>When a <code>D3DLOCK_DISCARD</code> map is made, the D3D thread immediately asks the allocator for a new slice of GPU memory and returns it. The command stream thread is sent an asynchronous message informing it of the discard, with information on the new buffer location so that future draw commands on the command stream thread are aware. The command stream thread returns its old buffer to the heap allocator when this happens, with a fence to ensure that the buffer isn’t reused until it is no longer being used by the GPU.</p><p>When a <code>D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE</code> map is made, we can just return the buffer’s mapped base address plus the offset desired. Sweet!</p><p>Otherwise, the old synchronous path is undergone- except this time, without requiring a call to <code>glMapBufferRange</code> (only waiting on a fence).</p><p>So, what does this look like?</p><div><img src=\"../images/wine-pba-pipeline-good.png\" alt=\"GPU doesn’t have to stall while threads are synchronizing.

I settled for using the console command <code>/timetest 1</code>, which measures the average FPS when taking a flight path- no ground NPCs or players are loaded while in-flight to reduce variation in test runs. Additionally, I eyeballed the average idle FPS in various common in-game locations.</p><p><em>These benchmarks were performed on patch 7.3.5 running with 4x SSAA at a resolution of 2560x1440.

This is a massivemilestone release, featuring a substantial revamp of mitmproxy’s internalstructure and serious improvements in all tools across the board. Everyone shouldupdate!</p><p>The project’s momentum remains fearsome: this release features 1235 commits by56 contributors, resulting in 287 closed issues and 308 merged PRs. With thisrelease, we’re also launching a new website (you’re looking at it), a newproject blog (you’re reading this release notice on it), and <a href=\"../../../docs/latest\">cleanerdocs</a>.</p><p>Let’s dig into the details.</p><h2 id=\"internals\">Internals</h2><p>Mitmproxy now has a powerful new <a href=\"../../../docs/latest/addons-overview/\">addoninfrastructure</a>. Addons can hook into mitmproxy’s<a href=\"../../../docs/latest/addons-events/\">internal events</a>, can expose <a href=\"../../../docs/latest/addons-options\">typedoptions</a> for configuration, and can create <a href=\"../../../docs/latest/addons-events/\">typedcommands</a> for user interaction. We’ve migrated muchof mitmproxy’s <a href=\"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/master/mitmproxy/addons\">own functionality into a set of internaladdons</a>,resulting in a much cleaner and more maintainable code structure.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of this change is the power it givesthird-party addons and user scripts. We expose precisely the same functionalitymitmproxy uses for itself to users. Typed options declared by addonsautomatically appear in type-aware options editors in the official tools, areautomatically included in configuration files, and can automatically becontrolled from the command line. Typed commands exposed by addons get tabcompletion in mitmproxy console for free, and can be bound to keys. If you’reworking on an extension of mitmproxy, please let us know - mitmproxy addons arenow more powerful and easier to write than ever, and we’d like your feedback tohelp us make them better still.</p><h2 id=\"mitmproxy-console\">Mitmproxy console</h2><figure><img src=\"./mitmproxy-v3.png\"/></figure><p>The mitmproxy console app has been rebuilt around the new addon mechanism. Everyuser interaction and key binding simply invokes an addon command. Keystrokes canbe bound directly to commands, and the command language can be invoked from aninteractive, smart, syntax-aware prompt. User addons and scripts are first-classcitizens, and get the same tab completion, type-aware options editor and keybinding support as builtins.</p><p>The introduction of <a href=\"../../../docs/latest/concepts-commands\">commands</a> makes mitmproxy amassively more flexible and powerful tool. Any operation on flows can be invokedfrom the command prompt and combined with flow selectors. So, for instance, wecan replay all flows with the domain “google.com” like so:</p><figure><img src=\"./command-example.png\"/></figure><p>Along with this comes many, many user interface improvements. Major changesinclude horizontal and vertical multi-pane layouts, customizable keybindings, anoptions editor, and a command palette. There are too many minor improvements tolist, but my personal favourite is the new “B” keybinding (the <code>browser.start</code>command), which opens an isolated instance of Chrome automatically set up to gothrough the running proxy. Very handy.</p><h2 id=\"mitmweb-protocol-support-and-others\">Mitmweb, protocol support and others</h2><p>As usual, there are many other improvements in this release. Mitmweb, themitmproxy web interface, has continued to mature with a new options editor, andmany other improvements. This will open a slew of new use cases for our toolsetdown the track. Mitmproxy’s content views - including the beautifiers forJavaScript and CSS and image summary viewers - are now faster and better. Ourunderlying protocol support has improved, with a better websockets stack and theintroduction of request streaming for HTTP1 and HTTP2.</p><p>For a complete list of changes, see the<a href=\"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/CHANGELOG\">CHANGELOG</a>.</p><h2 id=\"gsoc\">GSoC</h2><p>Of special note during this release cycle is the work of our two brilliant<a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\">Google Summer of Code 2017</a> students, whoparticipated in mitmproxy’s development under the umbrella of the <a href=\"https://www.honeynet.org/\">HoneynetProject</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/matthewshao\">MatthewShao</a> made major improvements to the mitmproxyweb interface, including adding a new options editor, vastly improving ourtesting, and working on a static web viewer for mitmproxy dumps. Matthew wrote adetailed blog about his work on the <a href=\"http://honeynet.org/node/1359\">HoneyNetblog</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/ujjwal96\">UjjwalVerma</a> pushed our content views and protocol layersahead very significantly. You can thank him for faster, more stable decoding ofimages, protobufs, and better prettifying of JavaScript and CSS. He alsomigrated our websockets implementation to<a href=\"https://github.com/python-hyper/wsproto\">wsproto</a>, and added request streamingto HTTP1 and HTTP2.

Let's take a closer look under the hood of an SSTable and how LevelDB makes use of it.</p><h2>SSTable: Sorted String Table</h2><p>Imagine we need to process a large workload where the input is in Gigabytes or Terabytes in size. Additionally, we need to run multiple steps on it, which must be performed by different binaries - in other words, imagine we are running a sequence of Map-Reduce jobs! Due to size of input, reading and writing data can dominate the running time. Hence, random reads and writes are not an option, instead we will want to stream the data in and once we're done, flush it back to disk as a streaming operation. This way, we can <a href=\"http://www.igvita.com/2009/06/23/measuring-optimizing-io-performance/\">amortize the disk I/O costs</a>. Nothing revolutionary, moving right along.</p><p>A \"Sorted String Table\" then is exactly what it sounds like, it is a file which contains a set of arbitrary, sorted key-value pairs inside. Duplicate keys are fine, there is no need for \"padding\" for keys or values, and keys and values are arbitrary blobs. Read in the entire file sequentially and you have a sorted index. Optionally, if the file is very large, we can also prepend, or create a standalone <code>key:offset</code> index for fast access. <strong>That's all an SSTable is: very simple, but also a very useful way to exchange large, sorted data segments.</strong></p><h2>SSTable and BigTable: Fast random access?</h2><p>Once an SSTable is on disk it is effectively immutable because an insert or delete would require a large I/O rewrite of the file. Having said that, for static indexes it is a great solution: read in the index, and you are always one disk seek away, or simply <code>memmap</code> the entire file to memory. Random reads are fast and easy.</p><p>Random writes are much harder and expensive, that is, unless the entire table is in memory, in which case we're back to simple pointer manipulation. Turns out, this is the very problem that <a href=\"http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html\">Google's BigTable</a> set out to solve: fast read/write access for petabyte datasets in size, backed by SSTables underneath. How did they do it?</p><h2>SSTables and Log Structured Merge Trees</h2><p>We want to preserve the fast read access which SSTables give us, but we also want to support fast random writes. Turns out, we already have all the necessary pieces: random writes are fast when the SSTable is in memory (let's call it <code>MemTable</code>), and if the table is immutable then an on-disk SSTable is also fast to read from. Now let's introduce the following conventions:</p><ol><li><strong>On-disk <code>SSTable</code> indexes are always loaded into memory</strong></li><li><strong>All writes go directly to the <code>MemTable</code> index</strong></li><li><strong>Reads check the MemTable first and then the SSTable indexes</strong></li><li>Periodically, the MemTable is flushed to disk as an SSTable</li><li>Periodically, on-disk SSTables are \"collapsed together\"</li></ol><p>What have we done here? Writes are always done in memory and hence are always fast. Once the <code>MemTable</code> reaches a certain size, it is flushed to disk as an immutable <code>SSTable</code>. However, we will maintain all the SSTable indexes in memory, which means that for any read we can check the MemTable first, and then walk the sequence of SSTable indexes to find our data. Turns out, we have just reinvented the \"<a href=\"http://nosqlsummer.org/paper/lsm-tree\">The Log-Structured Merge-Tree</a>\" (<strong>LSM Tree</strong>), described by Patrick O'Neil, and this is also the very mechanism behind \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable#Design\">BigTable Tablets</a>\".</p><h2>LSM & SSTables: Updates, Deletes and Maintenance</h2><p>This \"LSM\" architecture provides a number of interesting behaviors: <strong>writes are always fast</strong> regardless of the size of dataset (append-only), and <strong>random reads are either served from memory or require a quick disk seek</strong>. However, what about updates and deletes?</p><p>Once the SSTable is on disk, it is immutable, hence updates and deletes can't touch the data. Instead, a more recent value is simply stored in <code>MemTable</code> in case of update, and a <em>\"tombstone\"</em> record is appended for deletes. Because we check the indexes in sequence, future reads will find the updated or the tombstone record without ever reaching the older values! Finally, having hundreds of on-disk SSTables is also not a great idea, hence <strong>periodically we will run a process to merge the on-disk SSTables, at which time the update and delete records will overwrite and remove the older data</strong>.</p><h2>SSTables and LevelDB</h2><p>Take an <code>SSTable</code>, add a <code>MemTable</code> and apply a set of processing conventions and what you get is a nice database engine for certain type of workloads. In fact, Google's BigTable, Hadoop's HBase, and Cassandra amongst others are all using a variant or a direct copy of this very architecture.</p><p>Simple on the surface, but as usual, implementation details matter a great deal. Thankfully, <a href=\"http://research.google.com/people/jeff/\">Jeff Dean</a> and <a href=\"http://research.google.com/people/sanjay/\">Sanjay Ghemawat</a>, the original contributors to the SSTable and BigTable infrastructure at Google <a href=\"http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/07/leveldb-fast-persistent-key-value-store.html\">released LevelDB earlier last year</a>, which is more or less an exact replica of the architecture we've described above:</p><ul><li>SSTable under the hood, MemTable for writes</li><li>Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays</li><li>Support for Put, Get, Delete operations</li><li>Forward and backward iteration over data</li><li>Built-in <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/snappy/\">Snappy compression</a></li></ul><p>Designed to be the engine for <a href=\"http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/html5storage/index.html#slide34\">IndexDB in WebKit</a> (aka, embedded in your browser), it is <a href=\"http://leveldb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html\">easy to embed</a>, <a href=\"http://leveldb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/benchmark.html\">fast</a>, and best of all, takes care of all the SSTable and MemTable flushing, merging and other gnarly details.</p><h2>Working with LevelDB: Ruby</h2><p>LevelDB is a library, not a standalone server or service - although you could easily implement one on top. To get started, grab your favorite language bindings (<a href=\"https://github.com/wmorgan/leveldb-ruby\">ruby</a>), and let's see what we can do:</p><div><pre><code><span>require</span><span>'leveldb'</span><span># gem install leveldb-ruby</span><span>db</span><span>=</span><span>LevelDB</span><span>::</span><span>DB</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>\"/tmp/db\"</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>\"b\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"bar\"</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>\"a\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"foo\"</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>\"c\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"baz\"</span><span>puts</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>\"a\"</span><span># => foo</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>each</span><span>do</span><span>|</span><span>k</span><span>,</span><span>v</span><span>|</span><span>p</span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span>,</span><span>v</span><span>]</span><span># => [\"a\", \"foo\"], [\"b\", \"bar\"], [\"c\", \"baz\"]</span><span>end</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span><span># => [[\"a\", \"foo\"], [\"b\", \"bar\"], [\"c\", \"baz\"]]</span></code></pre></div><p>We can store keys, retrieve them, and perform a range scan all with a few lines of code. The mechanics of maintaining the MemTables, merging the SSTables, and the rest is taken care for us by LevelDB - nice and simple.</p><h2>LevelDB in WebKit and Beyond</h2><p>SSTable is a very simple and useful data structure - a great bulk input/output format. However, what makes the SSTable fast (sorted and immutable) is also what exposes its very limitations. To address this, we've introduced the idea of a MemTable, and a set of \"log structured\" processing conventions for managing the many SSTables.</p><p>All simple rules, but as always, implementation details matter, which is why LevelDB is such a nice addition to the open-source database engine stack.

I belive they did&#x2F;are doing this because they are just disgusted with society, and their bike was their way of showing their disdain.  Disdain for putting money before family&#x2F;friends, and authority figures that abuse power.  That&#x27;s were I&#x27;m at.  I&#x27;m not into the whole gang thing.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve given up on Harley.  I don&#x27;t like the attention they bring anymore.  They are half the price they were in the nineties though, or at least on the used market.<p>My next bike will be made by me, with the best motor, and trans I can scrounge up.  It will have no company name on it.<p>So Harley demographics has changed greatly.  They are in a weird place right now.  They just closed a factory down in the Midwest.<p>Their demographics are guys who are now in their fifties, and those guys are selling their bikes on the used market.<p>When I looked at the electric bike, I just didn&#x27;t like the bike in the picture.  I didn&#x27;t like the top speed of 93 mph either.<p>So--I believe Harley still has some thinking out of the box ahead of them.  If I was in Harley white board meeting.  My recommendation would be sell a big bored generic bare bones bike.<p>A bike that only only had the primer on it. A simple bike. Keep the big V-twin.  A bike that could be customed by the owner.  And keep the cost of the bare boned model down.  If they got their price point down to $5500, I think they could \nmake a comeback.<p>Plus, the though of having a $25,000 motorcycle stolen is on everyone&#x27;s mind.<p>I do wish the company luck.","parent":16453564,"id":16454754,"dead":true,"by":"icantdrive55"}],"id":16453564,"by":"pwaai"},{"type":"comment","time":1519481026,"text":"One thing to understand, my Harley riding brethren, Harley <i>cannot</i> be targetting you.

Since then, I've received so many useful comments that I thought it was appropriate to expand the post into a more complete article. This article will go into greater depth on the subject, but I hope it'll be more comprehensible as well. You don't need to have read the previous post to understand this one (in fact, it's probably better if you haven't.) The only background knowledge I require is a tiny knowledge of the Scheme programming language including recursion and first-class functions, which I will review. Comments are (again) welcome.</p><a></a><h2>Why Y?</h2><p>Before I get into the details of what Y actually is, I'd like to addressthe question of why you, as a programmer, should bother to learn about it. Tobe honest, there aren't a lot of good nuts-and-bolts practical reasons forlearning about Y. Even though it does have a few practical applications, forthe most part it's mainly of interest to computer language theorists.Nevertheless, I do think it's worth your while to know something about Y forthe following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>It's one of the most beautiful ideas in all of programming. If you have any sense of programming aesthetics, you're sure to be delighted by Y.</p></li><li><p>It shows in a very stark way how amazingly powerful the simple ideas of functional programming are.</p></li></ol><p>In 1959, the British scientist C. P. Snow gave a famous lecture called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Two Cultures</a> where he bemoaned the fact that many intelligent and well-educated people of the time had almost no knowledge of science. He used knowledge of the Second Law of Thermodynamics as a kind of dividing line between those who were scientifically literate and those who weren't. I think we can similarly use knowledge of the Y combinator as a dividing line between programmers who are \"functionally literate\" (<i>i.e.</i> have a reasonably deep knowledge of functional programming) and those who aren't. There are other topics that could serve just as well as Y (notably monads), but Y will do nicely. So if you aspire to have the True Lambda-Nature, read on.</p><p>By the way, <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paul Graham</a> (the Lisp hacker, Lisp book author, essayist, and now venture capitalist) apparently thinks so highly of Y that he named his startup incubator company <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator</a>. Paul got rich from his knowledge of ideas like these; maybe someone else will too. Maybe even you.</p><hr/><h2>A puzzle</h2><h3>Factorials</h3><p>We'll start our exploration of the Y combinator by defining some functions to compute factorials. The factorial of a non-negative integer <code>n</code> is the product of all integers starting from <code>1</code> and going up to and including <code>n</code>. Thus we have:</p><pre> factorial 1 = 1 factorial 2 = 2 * 1 = 2 factorial 3 = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 factorial 4 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</pre><p>and so on. (I'm using a function notation without parentheses here, so <code>factorial 3</code>  is the same as what is usually written as <code>factorial(3)</code>.  Humor me.) Factorials increase veryrapidly with increasing <code>n</code>; the factorial of <code>20</code> is<code>2432902008176640000</code>. The factorial of <code>0</code> is definedto be <code>1</code>; this turns out to be the appropriate definition for the kinds of things factorials are actually used for (like solving problems incombinatorics).</p><h3>Recursive definitions of the factorial function</h3><p>It's easy to write a function in a programming language to compute factorials using some kind of a looping control construct like a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop (<i>e.g.</i> in C or Java). However, it's also easy to write a recursive function to compute factorials, because factorials have a very natural recursive definition:</p><pre> factorial 0 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)</pre><p>where the second line applies for all <code>n</code> greater than zero. Infact, in the computer language <a href=\"http://www.haskell.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haskell</a>,that's the way you actually define the factorial function. In <a href=\"http://www.schemers.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scheme</a>, the language we'll be using here,this function would be written like this:</p><pre> (define (factorial n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))</pre><p>Scheme uses a parenthesized prefix notation for everything, so something like <code> (- n 1) </code> represents what is usually written <code> n - 1 </code> in most programming languages. The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this article, but getting used to this notation isn't very hard.</p><p>In fact, the above definition of the factorial function in Scheme could also be written in a slightly more explicit way as follows:</p><pre> (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))</pre><p>The keyword <code>lambda</code> simply indicates that the thing we'redefining (<i>i.e.</i> whatever is enclosed by the open parenthesis to theimmediate left of the <code>lambda</code> and its corresponding closeparenthesis) is a function. What comes immediately after the word<code>lambda</code>, in parentheses, are the <i>formal arguments</i> of thefunction; here there is just one argument, which is <code>n</code>. The<i>body</i> of the function comes after the formal arguments, and hereconsists of the expression <code>(if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n1))))</code>. This kind of function is an <i>anonymous function</i>. Here youdo give the anonymous function the name <code>factorial</code> after you'vedefined it, but you don't have to, and often it's handy not to if you're onlygoing to be using it once. In Scheme and some other languages, anonymousfunctions are also called <i>lambda expressions</i>. Many programminglanguages besides Scheme allow you to define anonymous functions, includingPython, Ruby, Javascript, Ocaml, and Haskell (but not C, C++, or Java,unfortunately). We'll be using lambda expressions a lot below.</p><p>In the Scheme language, the definition of <code>factorial</code> just givenis identical to the one before it; Scheme simply translates the firstdefinition into the second one before evaluating it. So all functions inScheme are really lambda expressions.</p><p>Note that the body of the function has a call to the <code>factorial</code>function (which we're in the process of defining) inside it, which makes thisa recursive definition. I will call this kind of definition, where the name ofthe function being defined is used in the body of the function, an<i>explicitly recursive definition</i>. (You might wonder what an \"implicitlyrecursive\" function would be. I'm not going to use that expression, but thenotion I have in mind is a recursive function which is generated throughnon-recursive means — keep reading!)</p><p>For the sake of argument, we're going to assume that our version of Schemedoesn't have the equivalent of <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loops inC or Java (although in fact, real Scheme implementations do have suchconstructs, but under a different name), so that in order to define a functionlike <code>factorial</code>, we pretty much have to use recursion. Scheme isoften used as a teaching language partly for this reason: it forces studentsto learn to think recursively.</p><h3>Functions as data and higher-order functions</h3><p>Scheme is a cool language for many reasons, but one that is relevant to ushere is that it allows you to use functions as \"first class\" data objects(this is often expressed by saying that Scheme supports <i>first-classfunctions</i>). This means that in Scheme, we can pass a function to anotherfunction as an argument, we can return a function as the result of evaluatinganother function applied to its arguments, and we can create functionson-the-fly as we need them (using the <code>lambda</code> notation shownabove). This is the essence of functional programming, and it will featureprominently in the ensuing discussion. Functions which take other functions asarguments, and/or which return other functions as their results, are usuallyreferred to as <i>higher-order functions</i>.</p><h3>Eliminating explicit recursion</h3><p>Now, here's the puzzle: what if you were asked to define the<code>factorial</code> function in Scheme, but were told that you could notuse recursive function calls in the definition (for instance, in the<code>factorial</code> function given above you cannot use the word<code>factorial</code> anywhere in the body of the function). However, you<i>are</i> allowed to use first-class functions and higher-order functions anyway you see fit. With this knowledge, can you define the<code>factorial</code> function?</p><p>The answer to this question is yes, and it will lead us directly to the Ycombinator.</p><hr/><h2>What the Y combinator is and what it does</h2><p>The Y combinator is a higher-order function. It takes a single argument,which is a function that isn't recursive. It returns a version of the functionwhich is recursive. We will walk through this process of generating recursivefunctions from non-recursive ones using Y in great detail below, but that'sthe basic idea.</p><p>More generally, Y gives us a way to get recursion in a programming languagethat supports first-class functions but that doesn't have recursion built into it. So what Y shows us is that such a language already allows us to definerecursive functions, even though the language definition itself says nothingabout recursion. This is a Beautiful Thing: it shows us that functionalprogramming alone can allow us to do things that we would never expect to beable to do (and it's not the only example of this).</p><h3>Lazy or strict evaluation?</h3><p>We will be looking at two broad classes of computer languages: those that use <i>lazy evaluation</i> and those that use <i>strict evaluation</i>. Lazyevaluation means that in order to evaluate an expression in the language, youonly evaluate as much of the expression as is needed to get the final result.So (for instance) if there is a part of the expression that doesn't need toget evaluated (because the result will not depend on it) it won't beevaluated. In contrast, strict evaluation means that all parts of anevaluation will be evaluated completely before the value of the expression asa whole is determined (with some necessary exceptions, such as<code>if</code> expressions, which have to be lazy to work properly). Inpractice, lazy evaluation is more general, but strict evaluation is morepredictable and often more efficient. Most programming languages use strictevaluation. The programming language <a href=\"http://www.haskell.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haskell</a> uses lazy evaluation, and this isone of the most interesting things about that language. We will use both kindsof evaluation in what follows.</p><h3>One Y combinator or many?</h3><p>Even though we often refer to Y as \"the\" Y combinator, in actual fact thereare an infinite number of Y combinators. We will only be concerned with two ofthese, one lazy and one strict. We need two Y combinators because the Ycombinator we define for lazy languages will not work for strict languages.The lazy Y combinator is often referred to as the <i>normal-order Ycombinator</i> and the strict one is referred to as the <i>applicative-order Ycombinator</i>. Basically, <i>normal-order</i> is another way of saying \"lazy\"and <i>applicative-order</i> is another way of saying \"strict\".</p><h3>Static or dynamic typing?</h3><p>Another big dividing line in programming languages is between <i>statictyping</i> and <i>dynamic typing</i>. A statically-typed language is one wherethe types of all expressions are determined at compile time, and any typeerrors cause the compilation to fail. A dynamically-typed language doesn't doany type checking until run time, and if a function is applied to arguments ofinvalid types (<i>e.g.</i> by trying to add together an integer and a string),then an error is reported. Among commonly-used programming languages, C, C++and Java are statically typed, and Perl, Python and Ruby are dynamicallytyped. Scheme (the language we'll be using for our examples) is alsodynamically typed. (There are also languages that straddle the border betweenstatically-typed and dynamically-typed, but I won't discuss thisfurther.)</p><p>One often hears static typing referred to as <i>strong typing</i> anddynamic typing referred to as <i>weak typing</i>, but this is an abuse ofterminology. Strong typing simply means that every value in the language hasone and only one type, whereas weak typing means that some values can havemultiple types. So Scheme, which is dynamically typed, is also strongly typed,while C, which is statically typed, is weakly typed (because you can cast apointer to one kind of object into a pointer to another type of object withoutaltering the pointer's value). I will only be concerned with strongly typedlanguages here.</p><p>It turns out to be much simpler to define the Y combinator in dynamicallytyped languages, so that's what I'll do. It is possible to define a Ycombinator in many statically typed languages, but (at least in the examplesI've seen) such definitions usually require some non-obvious type hackery,because the Y combinator itself doesn't have a straightforward static type.That's beyond the scope of this article, so I won't mention it further.</p><h3>What a \"combinator\" is</h3><p>A combinator is just a <i>lambda expression</i> with no <i>freevariables</i>. We saw above what lambda expressions are (they're justanonymous functions), but what's a free variable? It's a variable (<i>i.e.</i> a name or identifier in the language) which isn't a <i>boundvariable</i>. Happy now? No? OK, let me explain.</p><p>A bound variable is simply a variable which is contained inside the body of a lambda expression that has that variable name as one of its arguments.</p><p>Let's look at some examples of lambda expressions and free and bound variables:</p><ol><li><code>(lambda (x) x)</code></li><li><code>(lambda (x) y)</code></li><li><code>(lambda (x) (lambda (y) x))</code></li><li><code>(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (x y)))</code></li><li><code>(x (lambda (y) y))</code></li><li><code>((lambda (x) x) y)</code></li></ol><p>Are the variables in the body of these lambda expressions free variables or bound variables? We'll ignore the formal arguments of the lambda expressions, because only variables in the body of the lambda expression can be considered free or bound. As for the other variables, here are the answers:</p><ol><li>The <code>x</code> in the body of the lambda expression is a boundvariable, because the formal argument of the lambda expression is also<code>x</code>. This lambda expression has no other variables, therefore ithas no free variables, therefore it's a combinator.</li><li>The <code>y</code> in the lambda body is a free variable. This lambda expression is therefore not a combinator.</li><li>Aside from the formal arguments of the lambda expression, there is only one variable, the final <code>x</code>, which is a bound variable (it's bound by the formal argument of the outer lambda expression). Therefore, this lambda expression as a whole has no free variables, so this is a combinator.</li><li>Aside from the formal arguments of the lambda expression, there are two variables, the final <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, both bound variables. This is a combinator.</li><li>The entire expression is not a lambda expression, so it's by definition not a combinator. Nevertheless, the <code>x</code> is a free variable and the final <code>y</code> is a bound variable.</li><li>Again, the entire expression isn't a lambda expression (it's a function application), so this isn't a combinator either. The second <code>x</code> is a bound variable while the <code>y</code> is a free variable.</li></ol><p>When you're wondering if a recursive function like<code>factorial</code>:</p><pre> (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))</pre><p>is a combinator, you don't consider the <code>define</code> part, so what you're really asking is if</p><pre> (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))</pre><p>is a combinator. Since in this lambda expression, the name<code>factorial</code> represents a free variable (the name<code>factorial</code> is not a formal argument of the lambda expression), this is not a combinator. This will be important below. In fact, the names <code>=</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>-</code> are also free variables, so even without the name <code>factorial</code> this would not be a combinator (to say nothing of the numbers!).</p><hr/><h2>Back to the puzzle</h2><h3>Abstracting out the recursive function call</h3><p>Recall the factorial function we had previously:</p><pre> (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))</pre><p>What we want to do is to come up with a version of this that does the same thing but doesn't have that pesky recursive call to <code>factorial</code> in the body of the function.</p><p>Where do we start? It would be nice if you could save all of the function except for the offending recursive call, and put something else there. That might look like this:</p><pre> (define sort-of-factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (<???> (- n 1))))))</pre><p>This still leaves us with the problem of what to put in the place marked <code><???></code>. It's a tried-and-true principle of functional programming that if you don't know exactly what you want to put somewhere in a piece of code, just abstract it out and make it a parameter of a function. The easiest way to do this is as follows:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))))</pre><p>What we've done here is to rename the recursive call to<code>factorial</code> to <code>f</code>, and to make <code>f</code> anargument to a function which we're calling <code>almost-factorial</code>.Notice that <code>almost-factorial</code> is not at all the factorialfunction. Instead, it's a higher-order function which takes a single argument<code>f</code>, which had better be a function (or else <code>(f (- n1))</code> won't make sense), and <i>returns</i> another function (the<code>(lambda (n) ...)</code> part) which (hopefully) will be a factorialfunction if we choose the right value for <code>f</code>.</p><p>It's important to realize that this trick is not in any way specific to the <code>factorial</code> function. We can do exactly the same trick with any recursive function. For instance, consider a recursive function to compute fibonacci numbers. The recursive definition of fibonacci numbers is as follows:</p><pre> fibonacci 0 = 0 fibonacci 1 = 1 fibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)</pre><p>(In fact, that's the definition of the fibonacci function in Haskell.) In Scheme, we can write the function this way:</p><pre> (define fibonacci (lambda (n) (cond ((= n 0) 0) ((= n 1) 1) (else (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))))</pre><p>(where <code>cond</code> is just a shorthand expression for nested <code>if</code> expressions). We can then remove the explicit recursion just like we did for <code>factorial</code>:</p><pre> (define almost-fibonacci (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (cond ((= n 0) 0) ((= n 1) 1) (else (+ (f (- n 1)) (f (- n 2))))))))</pre><p>As you can see, the transformation from a recursive function to a non-recursive <code>almost-</code> equivalent function is a purely mechanical one: you rename the name of the recursive function inside the body of the function to <code>f</code> and you wrap a <code>(lambda (f) ...)</code> around the body.</p><p>If you've followed what I just did (never mind <i>why</i> I did it; we'll see that later), then congratulations! As Yoda says, you've just taken the first step into a larger world.</p><h3>Sneak preview</h3><p>I probably shouldn't do this yet, but I'm going to give you a sneak preview of where we're going. Once we define the Y combinator, we'll be able to define the factorial function using <code>almost-factorial</code> as follows:</p><pre> (define factorial (Y almost-factorial))</pre><p>where <code>Y</code> is the Y combinator. Note that this definition of<code>factorial</code> doesn't have any explicit recursion in it. Similarly,we can define the <code>fibonacci</code> function using<code>almost-fibonacci</code> in the same way:</p><pre> (define fibonacci (Y almost-fibonacci))</pre><p>So the Y combinator will give us recursion wherever we need it as long as we have the appropriate <code>almost-</code> function available (<i>i.e.</i> the non-recursive function derived from the recursive one by abstracting out the recursive function calls).</p><p>Read on to see what's really going on here and why this will work.</p><h3>Recovering <code>factorial</code> from <code>almost-factorial</code></h3><p>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that we already had a working factorial function lying around (recursive or not, we don't care). We'll call that hypothetical factorial function <code>factorialA</code>. Now let's consider the following:</p><pre> (define factorialB (almost-factorial factorialA))</pre><p>Question: does <code>factorialB</code> actually compute factorials?</p><p>To answer this, it's helpful to expand out the definition of <code>almost-factorial</code>:</p><pre> (define factorialB ((lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))) factorialA))</pre><p>Now, by substituting <code>factorialA</code> for <code>f</code> inside the body of the lambda expression we get:</p><pre> (define factorialB (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorialA (- n 1))))))</pre><p>This looks a lot like the recursive factorial function, but it isn't:<code>factorialA</code> is not the same function as <code>factorialB</code>.So it's a non-recursive function that depends on a hypothetical<code>factorialA</code> function to work. Does it actually work? Well, it'spretty obvious that it should work for <code>n = 0</code>, since<code>(factorialB 0)</code> will just return <code>1</code> (the factorial of<code>0</code>). If <code>n > 0</code>, then the value of <code>(factorialBn)</code> will be <code>(* n (factorialA (- n 1)))</code>. Now, we assumedthat <code>factorialA</code> would correctly compute factorials, so<code>(factorialA (- n 1))</code> is the factorial of <code>n - 1</code>, andtherefore <code>(* n (factorialA (- n 1)))</code> is the factorial of<code>n</code> (by the definition of factorial), thus proving that<code>factorialB</code> computes the factorial function correctly as long as<code>factorialA</code> does. So this works. The only problem is that we don'tactually have a <code>factorialA</code> lying around.</p><p>Now, if you're really clever, you might be asking yourself whether we can just do this:</p><pre> (define factorialA (almost-factorial factorialA))</pre><p>The idea is this: let's assume that <code>factorialA</code> is a valid factorial function. Then if we pass it as an argument to <code>almost-factorial</code>, the resulting function will have to be a valid factorial function, so why not just name that function <code>factorialA</code>?</p><p>It looks like you've created a perpetual-motion machine (or perhaps I should say a perpetual-calculation machine), and there must be <i>something</i> wrong with this definition... mustn't there?</p><p>In fact, this definition will work fine as long as the Scheme language you're using uses lazy evaluation! Standard Scheme uses strict evaluation, so it won't work (it'll go into an infinite loop). If you use <a href=\"http://www.drscheme.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrScheme</a> as your Scheme interpreter (which you should), then you can use the \"lazy Scheme\" language level, and the above code will actually work (huzzah!). We'll see why below, but for now I want to stick to standard (strict) Scheme and approach the problem in a slightly different way.</p><p>Let's define a couple of functions:</p><pre> (define identity (lambda (x) x)) (define factorial0 (almost-factorial identity))</pre><p>The <code>identity</code> function is pretty simple: it takes in a singleargument and returns it unchanged (it's also a combinator, as I hope you cantell). We're basically going to use it as a placeholder when we need to pass afunction as an argument and we don't know what function we should pass.</p><p><code>factorial0</code> is more interesting. It's a function that can compute <i>some</i>, but not <i>all</i> factorials. Specifically, it can compute the factorials up to and including the factorial of zero (which means that it can only compute the factorial of zero, but you'll soon see why I describe it this way). Let's verify that:</p><pre> (factorial0 0) ==> ((almost-factorial identity) 0) ==> (((lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))) identity) 0) ==> ((lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (identity (- n 1))))) 0) ==> (if (= 0 0) 1 (* 0 (identity (- 0 1)))) ==> (if #t 1 (* 0 (identity (- 0 1)))) ==> 1</pre><p>OK, so it works. Unfortunately, it won't work for <code>n > 0</code>. For instance, if <code>n = 1</code> then we'll have (skipping a few obvious steps):</p><pre> (factorial0 1) ==> (* 1 (identity (- 1 1))) ==> (* 1 (identity 0)) ==> (* 1 0) ==> 0</pre><p>which is not the correct answer.</p><p>Now consider this spiffed-up version of <code>factorial0</code>:</p><pre> (define factorial1 (almost-factorial factorial0))</pre><p>which is the same thing as:</p><pre> (define factorial1 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity)))</pre><p>This will correctly compute the factorials of <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, but it will be incorrect for any <code>n > 1</code>. Let's verify this as well, again skipping some obvious steps:</p><pre> (factorial1 0) ==> ((almost-factorial factorial0) 0) ==> 1 (via essentially the same derivation we showed above) (factorial1 1) ==> ((almost-factorial factorial0) 1) ==> (((lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))) factorial0) 1) ==> ((lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial0 (- n 1))))) 1) ==> (if (= 1 0) 1 (* 1 (factorial0 (- 1 1)))) ==> (if #f 1 (* 1 (factorial0 (- 1 1)))) ==> (* 1 (factorial0 (- 1 1))) ==> (* 1 (factorial0 0)) ==> (* 1 1) ==> 1</pre><p>which is the correct answer. So <code>factorial1</code> can compute factorials for <code>n = 0</code> and <code>n = 1</code>. You can verify, though, that it won't be correct for <code>n > 1</code>.</p><p>We can keep going, and define functions which can compute factorials up to any particular limit:</p><pre> (define factorial2 (almost-factorial factorial1)) (define factorial3 (almost-factorial factorial2)) (define factorial4 (almost-factorial factorial3)) (define factorial5 (almost-factorial factorial4)) etc.</pre><p><code>factorial2</code> will compute correct factorials for inputs between <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>, <code>factorial3</code> will compute correct factorials for inputs between <code>0</code> and <code>3</code>, and so on. You should be able to verify this for yourself using the above derivations as models, though you probably won't be able to do it in your head (at least, <i>I</i> can't do it in my head).</p><p>One interesting way of looking at this is that <code>almost-factorial</code> takes in a crappy factorial function and outputs a factorial function that is slightly less crappy, in that it will handle exactly one extra value of the input correctly.</p><p>Note that you can again rewrite the definitions of the factorial functions like this:</p><pre> (define factorial0 (almost-factorial identity)) (define factorial1 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity))) (define factorial2 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity)))) (define factorial3 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity))))) (define factorial4 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity)))))) (define factorial5 (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial identity)))))))</pre><p>and so on. Again, if you're very clever you might wonder if you could do this:</p><pre> (define factorial-infinity (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial ...))))</pre><p>where the <code>...</code> means that you're repeating the chain of<code>almost-factorials</code> an infinite number of times. If you did wonderthis, go to the head of the class! Unfortunately, we can't write this outdirectly, but we can define the equivalent of this. Note also that<code>factorial-infinity</code> is just the <code>factorial</code> function wewant: it works on all integers greater than or equal to zero.</p><p>What we have shown is that if we could define an infinite chain of<code>almost-factorials</code>, that would give us the factorial function.Another way of saying this is that the factorial function is the<i>fixpoint</i> of <code>almost-factorial</code>, which is what I will explainnext.</p><h3>Fixpoints of functions</h3><p>The notion of a fixpoint should be familiar to anyone who has amusedthemselves playing with a pocket calculator. You start with <code>0</code> andhit the <code>cos</code> (cosine) key repeatedly. What you find is that theanswer rapidly converges to a number which is (approximately)<code>0.73908513321516067</code>; hitting the <code>cos</code> key againdoesn't change anything because <code>cos(0.73908513321516067) =0.73908513321516067</code>. We say that the number<code>0.73908513321516067</code> is a <i>fixpoint</i> of the cosinefunction.</p><p>The cosine function takes a single input value (a real number) and producesa single output value (also a real number). The fact that the input and outputof the function are the same type is what allows you to apply it repeatedly,so that if <code>x</code> is a real number, we can calculate what<code>cos(x)</code> is, and since that will also be a real number, we cancalculate what <code>cos(cos(x))</code> is, and then what<code>cos(cos(cos(x)))</code> is, and so on. The fixpoint is the value<code>x</code> where <code>cos(x) = x</code>.</p><p>Fixpoints don't have to be real numbers. In fact, they can be any type ofthing, as long as the function that generates them can take the same type ofthing as input as it produces as output. Most importantly for our discussion,fixpoints can be functions. If you have a higher-order function like<code>almost-factorial</code> that takes in a function as its input andproduces a function as its output (with both input and output functions takinga single integer argument as input and producing a single integer as output),then it should be possible to compute its fixpoint (which will, naturally, bea function which takes a single integer argument as input and produces asingle integer as output). That fixpoint function will be the function forwhich</p><pre> fixpoint-function = (almost-factorial fixpoint-function)</pre><p>By repeatedly substituting the right-hand side of that equation into the <code>fixpoint-function</code> on the right, we get:</p><pre> fixpoint-function = (almost-factorial (almost-factorial fixpoint-function)) = (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial fixpoint-function))) = ... = (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial ...)))))</pre><p>As we saw above, this will be the factorial function we want. Thus, the fixpoint of <code>almost-factorial</code> will be the <code>factorial</code> function:</p><pre> factorial = (almost-factorial factorial) = (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial (almost-factorial ...)))))</pre><p>That's all well and good, but just <i>knowing</i> that <code>factorial</code> is the fixpoint of <code>almost-factorial</code> doesn't tell us how to compute it. Wouldn't it be nice if there was some magical higher-order function that would take as its input a function like <code>almost-factorial</code>, and would output its fixpoint function, which in that case would be <code>factorial</code>? Wouldn't that be really freakin' sweet?</p><p>That function exists, and it's the Y combinator. Y is also known as the <i>fixpoint combinator</i>: it takes in a function and returns its fixpoint.</p><h3>Eliminating (most) explicit recursion (lazy version)</h3><p>OK, it's time to derive Y.</p><p>Let's start by specifying what Y does:</p><pre> (Y f) = fixpoint-of-f</pre><p>What do we know about the fixpoint of <code>f</code>? We know that</p><pre> (f fixpoint-of-f) = fixpoint-of-f</pre><p>by the definition of what a fixpoint of a function is. Therefore, we have:</p><pre> (Y f) = fixpoint-of-f = (f fixpoint-of-f)</pre><p>and we can substitute <code>(Y f)</code> for <code>fixpoint-of-f</code> to get:</p><pre> (Y f) = (f (Y f))</pre><p>Voila! We've just defined Y. If we want it to be expressed as a Scheme function, we would have to write it like this:</p><pre> (define (Y f) (f (Y f)))</pre><p>or, using an explicit <code>lambda</code> expression, as:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) (f (Y f))))</pre><p>However, there are two caveats regarding this definition of Y:</p><ol><li><p>It will only work in a lazy language (see below).</p></li><li><p>It is not a combinator, because the <code>Y</code> in the body of the definition is a free variable which is only bound once the definition is complete. In other words, we couldn't just take the body of this version of <code>Y</code> and plop it in wherever we needed it, because it requires that the name <code>Y</code> be defined somewhere.</p></li></ol><p>Nevertheless, if you're using lazy Scheme, you can indeed define factorials like this:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) (f (Y f)))) (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial (Y almost-factorial))</pre><p>and it will work correctly.</p><p>What have we accomplished? We originally wanted to be able to define the factorial function without using any explicitly recursive functions at all. We've <i>almost</i> done that. Our definition of <code>Y</code> is still explicitly recursive. However, we've taken a giant step, because this is the <i>only</i> function in our language that needs to be explicitly recursive in order to define recursive functions. With this version of <code>Y</code> we can go ahead and define other recursive functions (for instance, defining <code>fibonacci</code> as <code>(Y almost-fibonacci)</code>).</p><h3>Eliminating (most) explicit recursion (strict version)</h3><p>I said above that the definition of Y that we derived wouldn't work in a strict language (like standard Scheme). In a strict language, we evaluate all the arguments to a function call before applying the function to its arguments, whether or not those arguments are needed. So if we have a function <code>f</code> and we try to evaluate <code>(Y f)</code> using the above definition, we get:</p><pre> (Y f) = (f (Y f)) = (f (f (Y f))) = (f (f (f (Y f)))) etc.</pre><p>and so on ad infinitum. The evaluation of <code>(Y f)</code> will never terminate, so we will never get a usable function out of it. This definition of Y doesn't work for strict languages.</p><p>However, there is a clever hack that we can use to save the day and definea version of Y that works in strict languages. The trick is to realize that<code>(Y f)</code> is going to become a function of one argument. Therefore,this equality will hold:</p><pre> (Y f) = (lambda (x) ((Y f) x))</pre><p>Whatever one-argument function <code>(Y f)</code> is, <code>(lambda (x) ((Yf) x))</code> has to be the same function. All you're doing is taking in asingle input value <code>x</code> and giving it to the function defined by<code>(Y f)</code>. In a similar way, this will be true:</p><pre> cos = (lambda (x) (cos x))</pre><p>It doesn't matter whether you use <code>cos</code> or <code>(lambda (x)(cos x))</code> as your cosine function; they will both do the same thing.</p><p>However, it turns out that <code>(lambda (x) ((Y f) x))</code> has a bigadvantage when defining Y in a strict language. By the reasoning given above,we should be able to define Y as follows:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) (f (lambda (x) ((Y f) x)))))</pre><p>Since we know that <code>(lambda (x) ((Y f) x))</code> is the same functionas <code>(Y f)</code>, this is a valid version of Y which will work just aswell as the previous version, even though it's a bit more complicated (andperhaps a tiny bit slower in practice). We could use this version of Y todefine the <code>factorial</code> function in lazy Scheme, and it would workfine.</p><p>The cool thing about <i>this</i> version of Y is that it will also work ina strict language (like standard Scheme)! The reason for this is that when yougive Y a particular <code>f</code> to find the fixpoint of, it will return</p><pre> (Y f) = (f (lambda (x) ((Y f) x)))</pre><p>This time, there is no infinite loop, because the inner <code>(Y f)</code>is kept inside a <code>lambda</code> expression, where it sits until it'sneeded (since the body of a lambda expression is never evaluated in Schemeuntil the lambda expression is applied to its arguments). Basically, you'reusing the lambda to delay the evaluation of <code>(Y f)</code>. So if<code>f</code> was <code>almost-factorial</code>, we would have this:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial (Y almost-factorial))</pre><p>Expanding out the call to Y, we have:</p><pre> (define factorial ((lambda (f) (f (lambda (x) ((Y f) x)))) almost-factorial)) ==> (define factorial (almost-factorial (lambda (x) ((Y almost-factorial) x)))) ==> (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n ((lambda (x) ((Y almost-factorial) x)) (- n 1))))))</pre><p>Here again, <code>(lambda (x) ((Y almost-factorial) x))</code> is the samefunction as <code>(Y almost-factorial)</code>, which is the fixpoint of<code>almost-factorial</code>, which is just the factorial function. However,the <code>(Y almost-factorial)</code> in <code>(lambda (x) ((Yalmost-factorial) x))</code> won't be evaluated until the entire lambdaexpression is applied to its argument, which won't happen until later (or notat all, for the factorial of zero). Therefore this factorial function willwork in a strict language, and the version of Y used to define it will alsowork in a strict language.</p><p>I realize that the preceding discussion and derivation is nontrivial, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away. Just sleep on it, play with it in your mind and with your trusty DrScheme interpreter, and you'll eventually get it.</p><p>At this point, we've accomplished everything we've set out to accomplish, except for one tiny little detail: we haven't yet derived the Y combinator itself.</p><hr/><h2>Deriving the Y combinator</h2><h3>The lazy (normal-order) Y combinator</h3><p>At this point, we want to define not just Y, but a Y <i>combinator</i>. Note that the previous (lazy) definition of Y:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) (f (Y f))))</pre><p>is a valid definition of Y but is not a Y combinator, since the definitionof Y refers to Y itself. In other words, this definition is explicitlyrecursive. A combinator isn't allowed to be explicitly recursive; it has to bea lambda expression with no free variables (as I mentioned above), which meansthat it can't refer to its own name (if it even has a name) in its definition.If it did, the name would be a free variable in the definition, as we have inour definition of Y:</p><pre> (lambda (f) (f (Y f)))</pre><p>Note that Y in this definition is free; it isn't the bound variable of anylambda expression. So this is not a combinator.</p><p>Another way to think about this is that you should be able to replace thename of a combinator with its definition everywhere it's found and haveeverything still work. (Can you see why this wouldn't work with the explicitlyrecursive definition of Y? You would get into an infinite loop and you'd neverbe able to replace all the Ys with their definitions.) So whatever the Ycombinator will be, it will not be explicitly recursive. From thisnon-recursive function we will be able to define whatever recursive functionswe want.</p><p>I'm going to go back a bit to our original problem and derive a Ycombinator from the bottom up. After I've done that I'll check to make sure that it is a fixpoint combinator, like the versions of Y we've already seen. In what follows I will borrow (steal) liberally from a very elegant derivation of the Y combinator sent to me by Eli Barzilay (thanks, Eli!), who is one of the DrScheme developers and an all-around Scheme uberstud.</p><p>Recall our original recursive <code>factorial</code> function:</p><pre> (define (factorial n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))</pre><p>Recall that we want to define a version of this without the explicit recursion. One way we could do this is to pass the factorial function itself as an extra argument when you call the function:</p><pre> ;; This won't work yet: (define (part-factorial self n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (self (- n 1)))))</pre><p>Note that <code>part-factorial</code> is not the same as the <code>almost-factorial</code> function described above. We would have to call this <code>part-factorial</code> function in a different way to get it to compute factorials:</p><pre> (part-factorial part-factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>This is not explicitly recursive because we send along an extra copy of the<code>part-factorial</code> function as the <code>self</code> argument.However, it won't work unless the point of recursion calls the function theexact same way:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (self self (- n 1))))) ;; note the extra \"self\" here (part-factorial part-factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>This works, but now we have moved away from our original way of calling the factorial function. We can move back to something closer to our original version by rewriting it like this:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n ((self self) (- n 1)))))) ((part-factorial part-factorial) 5) ==> 120 (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>Pause for a second here. Notice that we've <i>already</i> defined a versionof the factorial function without using explicit recursion anywhere! This isthe most crucial step. Everything else we do will be concerned with packagingwhat we've already done so that we can easily re-use it with otherfunctions.</p><p>Now let's try to get back something like our <code>almost-factorial</code> function by pulling out the <code>(self self)</code> call using a <code>let</code> expression outside of a <code>lambda</code>:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) (let ((f (self self))) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>This will work fine in a lazy language. In a strict language, the<code>(self self)</code> call in the <code>let</code> statement will send usinto an infinite loop, because in order to calculate <code>(part-factorialpart-factorial)</code> (in the definition of <code>factorial</code>) you willfirst have to calculate <code>(part-factorial part-factorial)</code> (in the<code>let</code> expression). (For fun: figure out why this wasn't a problemwith the previous definition.) I'll let this go for now, because I want todefine the lazy Y combinator, but in the next section I'll solve this problemin the same way we solved it before (by wrapping a <code>lambda</code> aroundthe <code>(self self)</code> call). Note that in a lazy language, the<code>(self self)</code> call in the <code>let</code> statement will never beevaluated unless <code>f</code> is actually needed (for instance, if <code>n =0</code> then <code>f</code> isn't needed to compute the answer, so<code>(self self)</code> won't be evaluated). Understanding how lazy languagesevaluate expressions is not trivial, so don't worry if you find this a littleconfusing. I recommend you experiment with the code using the lazy Schemelanguage level of DrScheme to get a better feel for what's going on.</p><p>It turns out that any <code>let</code> expression can be converted into an equivalent <code>lambda</code> expression using this equation:</p><pre> (let ((x <expr1>)) <expr2>) ==> ((lambda (x) <expr2>) <expr1>)</pre><p>where <code><expr1></code> and <code><expr2></code> are arbitrary Scheme expressions. (I'm only considering <code>let</code> expressions with a single binding and <code>lambda</code> expressions with a single argument, but the principle can easily be generalized to <code>lets</code> with multiple bindings and <code>lambdas</code> with multiple arguments.) This leads us to:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) ((lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))) (self self))) (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>If you look closely, you'll see that we have our old friend the<code>almost-factorial</code> function embedded inside the<code>part-factorial</code> function. Let's pull it outside:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define (part-factorial self) (almost-factorial (self self))) (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty fed up with this whole <code>(part-factorial part-factorial)</code> thing, and I'm not going to take it anymore! Fortunately, I don't have to; I can first rewrite the <code>part-factorial</code> function like this:</p><pre> (define part-factorial (lambda (self) (almost-factorial (self self))))</pre><p>Then I can rewrite the <code>factorial</code> function like this:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial (let ((part-factorial (lambda (self) (almost-factorial (self self))))) (part-factorial part-factorial))) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>The <code>factorial</code> function can be written a little more concisely by changing the name of <code>part-factorial</code> to <code>x</code> (since we aren't using this name anywhere else now):</p><pre> (define factorial (let ((x (lambda (self) (almost-factorial (self self))))) (x x)))</pre><p>Now let's use the same <code>let ==> lambda</code> trick we used above to get:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (self) (almost-factorial (self self))))) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>And again, to make this definition a little more concise, we can rename <code>self</code> to <code>x</code> to get:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (almost-factorial (x x))))) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>Note that the two <code>lambda</code> expressions in the definition of <code>factorial</code> both are functions of <code>x</code>, but the two <code>x</code>'s don't conflict with each other. In fact, we could have renamed <code>self</code> to <code>y</code> or almost any other name, but it'll be convenient to use <code>x</code> in what follows.</p><p>We're almost there! This works fine, but it's too specific to the <code>factorial</code> function. Let's change it to a generic <code>make-recursive</code> function that makes recursive functions from non-recursive ones (sound familiar?):</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define (make-recursive f) ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))) (define factorial (make-recursive almost-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>The <code>make-recursive</code> function is in fact the long-sought lazy Y combinator, also known as the <i>normal-order Y combinator</i>, so let's write it that way:</p><pre> (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define (Y f) ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))) (define factorial (Y almost-factorial))</pre><p>I'm going to expand out the definition of Y a little bit:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))))</pre><p>Note that we can apply the inner <code>lambda</code> expression to its argument to get an equivalent version of Y:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) ((lambda (x) (f (x x))) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))))</pre><p>What this means is that, for a given function <code>f</code> (which is a non-recursive function like <code>almost-factorial</code>), the corresponding recursive function can be obtained first by computing <code>(lambda (x) (f (x x)))</code>, and then applying this <code>lambda</code> expression to itself. This is the usual definition of the normal-order Y combinator.</p><p>The only thing left to do is to check that this Y combinator is a fixpointcombinator (which it has to be in order to compute the right thing). To dothis we have to demonstrate that this equation is correct:</p><pre> (Y f) = (f (Y f))</pre><p>From the definition of the normal-order Y combinator given above, we have:</p><pre> (Y f) = ((lambda (x) (f (x x))) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))</pre><p>Now apply the first lambda expression to its argument, which is the second lambda expression, to get this:</p><pre> = (f ((lambda (x) (f (x x))) (lambda (x) (f (x x))))) = (f (Y f))</pre><p>as desired. So, not only is the normal-order Y combinator also a fixpoint combinator, it's just about the most obvious fixpoint combinator there is, in that the proof that it's a fixpoint combinator is so trivial.</p><p>If you've made it through all of this derivation, you should pat yourself on the back and take a well-deserved break. When you come back, we'll finish off by deriving...</p><h3>The strict (applicative-order) Y combinator</h3><p>Let's pick up the previous derivation just before the point where it failedfor strict languages:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n ((self self) (- n 1)))))) ((part-factorial part-factorial) 5) ==> 120 (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>Up to this point, everything works in a strict language. Now if we pullthe <code>(self self)</code> out into a <code>let</code> expression as before,we have:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) (let ((f (self self))) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1))))))) (define factorial (part-factorial part-factorial)) (factorial 5) ==> 120</pre><p>As I said above, this will not work in a strict language, because wheneverthe <code>factorial</code> function is called it will evaluate the functioncall <code>(part-factorial part-factorial)</code>, and when that function callis evaluated it will first evaluate <code>(self self)</code> as part of the<code>let</code> expression, which in this case will be <code>(part-factorialpart-factorial)</code>, leading to an infinite loop of <code>(part-factorialpart-factorial)</code> calls.</p><p>We saw above that the way around problems like this is to realize that whatwe are trying to evaluate are functions of one argument. In this case,<code>(self self)</code> will be a function of one argument (it's going to be the same as <code>(part-factorial part-factorial)</code>, which is justthe <code>factorial</code> function). We can wrap a lambda expression aroundthis function to get an equivalent function:</p><pre> (define (part-factorial self) (let ((f (lambda (y) ((self self) y)))) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))))</pre><p>All we've done here is convert <code>(self self)</code>, a function of oneargument, to <code>(lambda (y) ((self self) y))</code>, an equivalent functionof one argument (we saw this trick earlier). I'm using <code>y</code> insteadof <code>x</code> as the variable binding of the new lambda expression so asnot to cause name conflicts later on in the derivation when <code>self</code>gets renamed to <code>x</code>, but I could have chosen another name aswell.</p><p>After we've done this, the <code>part-factorial</code> function will nowwork even in a strict language. That's because once <code>(part-factorialpart-factorial)</code> is evaluated, as part of evaluating the<code>let</code> expression the code <code>(lambda (x) ((self self) x))</code>will be evaluated. Unlike before, this will <i>not</i> send us into aninfinite loop; the lambda expression won't be evaluated further until it'sapplied to its argument. This lambda wrapper doesn't change the value of thething it wraps, but it does delay its evaluation, which is all we need to getthe definition of <code>part-factorial</code> to work in a strictlanguage.</p><p>And that's the trick. After that, we carry through every other step of the derivation in exactly the same way. We end up with this definition of the strict Y combinator:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) ((lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))) (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))))))</pre><p>This can also be written in the equivalent form:</p><pre> (define Y (lambda (f) ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))))))</pre><p>Hopefully, you can see why this is equivalent. Either of these are thestrict Y combinator, or as it's called in the technical literature, the<i>applicative-order Y combinator</i>. In a strict language (like standardScheme) you can use this to define the factorial function in the usualway:</p><pre> (define factorial (Y almost-factorial))</pre><p>I recommend you try this out with DrScheme, and lo! marvel at the awesome power of the applicative-order Y combinator, that which hath created recursion where no recursion hath previously existed.</p><hr/><h2>Other matters</h2><h3>Practical applications</h3><p>This article has (I hope) convinced you that you don't need to haveexplicit recursion built in to a language in order for that language to allowyou to define recursive functions, as long as the language supportsfirst-class functions so that you can define a Y combinator. However, I don'twant to leave you with the notion that recursion in real computer languages isimplemented this way. In practice, it's far more efficient to just implementrecursion directly in a computer language than to use the Y combinator. Thereare lots of other interesting issues that come up when considering how toimplement recursion efficiently, but those issues are beyond the scope of thisarticle. The point is that implementing recursion using the Y combinator ismainly of theoretical interest.</p><p>That said, in the paper <a href=\"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mcadams01practical.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y in PracticalPrograms</a>, Bruce McAdams discusses a few ways in which Y can be used todefine variants of recursive functions that <i>e.g.</i> print traces of theirexecution or automatically memoize their execution to give greater efficiency(as well as a few more esoteric applications), so Y isn't <i>just</i> atheoretical construct.</p><h3>Mutual Recursion</h3><p>Experienced functional programmers and/or particularly astute readersmay have noticed that I didn't describe how to use the Y combinator toimplement <i>mutual recursion</i>, which is where you have two or morefunctions which all call each other. The simplest example I can think of toillustrate mutual recursion are the following pair of functions which determinewhether a non-negative integer is even or odd:</p><pre> (define (even? n) (if (= n 0) #t (odd? (- n 1)))) (define (odd? n) (if (= n 0) #f (even? (- n 1))))</pre><p>Before you start yelling at me, yes, I know that this isn't the mostefficient way to compute evenness or oddness — it's just to illustratewhat mutual recursion is. Any computer language that supports recursivefunction definitions has to support mutual recursion as well, but I haven'tshown you how to use Y to define mutually-recursive functions. I'm going tocop out here because I think this article is long enough as it is, but restassured that it is possible to define analogs of Y that can definemutually-recursive functions.</p><hr/><h2>Further reading</h2><ul><li><p>The Wikipedia article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_combinator\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Y combinator</a> is somewhatdifficult reading, but it has some interesting material I didn't coverhere.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218099185&sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheLittle Schemer</a>, 4th. ed., by Dan Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

They actually do some intelligent estimations instead of just going with whatever anonymous &quot;analysts&quot; or &quot;experts&quot; in the financial markets say.<p>It&#x27;s a real issue for Tesla if they don&#x27;t figure out how to build 500,000 cars per year within the next 2-3 years because then they open up a flank for the traditional car manufacturers who probably need 3-4 years before they can market EVs that can compare in specs with model 3, most notably on range.<p>At around 200 miles&#x2F;320 km, an EV has a range that makes it suitable as a second car for the masses (as opposed to the passionate enthusiasts that might buy in already at 100 miles or less). 200 miles is enough for driving around the city. Currently, the Tesla models, Chevrolet Bolt, Renault Zoe, the new Nissan Leafs, and Opel Ampera, have such ranges. This is the range segment that the traditional car manufacturers are likely to open their first real bids for competitive EVs in from this year and through the next 3-4 years. Tesla can live with that since the segment is insufficient for the masses. Average Joe will not buy an electric car with a 200 mile range. Ever.<p>At around 300 miles&#x2F;480 km, an EV could be a real primary car if you live in regions with sufficient charging stations. Currently, only the larger Teslas and Model 3 are there. This is where Average Joe starts to buy. But the larger Teslas are too expensive for Average Joe. As for model 3, it can hardly be called a car for the masses until it is produced for the masses. And therein lies the problem. If Tesla doesn&#x27;t nail this range segment for higher end of the medium priced cars produced at scale in the next 2-3 years, some of the traditional car manufacturers may catch up. Don&#x27;t forget that even if Tesla reaches 350,000 cars in 2019, which is still a big if, they still leave most of the chips at the table. They will have to go way beyond 1M cars yearly to really close the upper medium price range for the traditional manufacturers. Even 500,000 cars would leave most of the market for a handful of it&#x27;s competitors. And it would require one or two more Giga Factories to reach a million, which they haven&#x27;t started to build yet. As for the lower priced cars, Tesla is not there yet, and the traditional car manufacturers may well get there before Tesla if they get to experiment for 4-5 years with the medium priced cars without loosing too much money. So Tesla really needs to hurry.<p>Around 400 miles&#x2F;640 km, range is no longer an issue for almost any buyer. The few exceptions are buyers in rural areas or buyers that need to commute very far to and from work every day in cold weather or in mountain regions. A 100 mile commute to work in subzero temperatures, and&#x2F;or in mountain regions would mean that you would have to be very sure that your car is fully charged every day, which would be too much of a hassle. But apart from such edge cases, most people could skip charging for a full working week and still use a car with 400 miles range for commutes. And on road trips, they could drive as far as is comfortable anyways, and if once every few years they needed to drive further than 400 miles, they would likely have passed several charging stations on the way. Currently, no cars are there, but Tesla will likely be first in this segment with the larger models S and X, quite possibly within 1-2 years. Those cars are not for the masses. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to believe though, that model 3 will have such range in 3-4 years.<p>At 500 miles&#x2F;800 km, the range issue is solved for 99 percent of potential buyers in the modern world. Tesla claims its new Roadster will have such range. It is still to be seen whether that is true, but anyways, that car is not for the masses. But maybe in 7-10 years, this will be standard in the smaller Teslas...","parent":16451666,"kids":[{"type":"comment","time":1519481455,"parent":16453160,"id":16453290,"deleted":true},{"type":"comment","time":1519486936,"text":"I believe a 100 mile range is enough for a city car or secondary car.

Typically it means scanning tons of resumes (typically this means stacks of 100s of applicants). In the aggregate, while there are exceptions, if it “looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck”.<p>So how does this translate to searching for candidates?<p>Well, in general when you are scanning resumes you are looking for “proxies” for quality (remember you are devoting maybe 30 - 60 seconds to each resume initially, and even at that rate it will take you 30+ minutes to get through the resume dump you have been given that day. This doesn’t count the extra time you spend on the most promising candidates.\nSo, what are good proxies?\nThe best proxies are competing companies for your industry, where they are <i>currently</i> working at. It shows they both 1. Are able to do an equivalent job, and 2. They know the specifics of your industry. \nNext best proxy: A similar job that they have done at any company (preferably at a company which you have heard of, and know hires good quality).\nThe next “goodness” proxy I use is “have they done anything I heard about, or can infer their competence from? An example is a project that I know is non trivial.\nThe final proxy you can use of course is a degree. Since it is known quantity of “work” that was needed to successfully complete that degree.<p>This is to say, if you don’t have a degree you need to “stand out” in some way. Show that you can “do” something valuable.<p>Remember at the end of the day the employer has to get “value” out of you. You need to provide some multiple of what you cost for it to be “worth” hiring you. Some numbers for context:\nFor 100k job, that usually translates to 160k all in cost for the employer (benefits, taxes, overhead, etc). Add in the risk you may not work out (if they are 90% certain, then they have to expect 177k of value just to break even).\nIf you are less solid of a candidate, say 50% chance of working out, then the number is 320k.<p>Either way, you need to give the expectation that you will give <i>way</i> more value then your cost given your risk profile.<p>So to circle back, how do you get these jobs? Find a way to demonstrate your “value” in the context of the employers needs or find ways of reducing your “risk” profile for them hiring you.<p>Hope this helps.","parent":16452759,"id":16453686,"by":"aerophilic"},{"type":"comment","time":1519486598,"text":"Hey, i use to have the same situation 5 years ago.

It underscores the huge promise of these high-capacity lines to unlock the full potential of renewable energy.</p><p>Transmission isn’t sexy (see our story art above). It’s basic infrastructure. Long wires and tall towers (see “<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609077/how-blockchain-could-give-us-a-smarter-energy-grid/\">How Blockchain Could Give Us a Smarter Energy Grid</a>”).</p><p>But a growing body of studies conclude that building out a nationwide network of DC transmission lines could help enable renewable sources to supplant the majority of U.S. energy generation, offering perhaps the fastest, cheapest, and most efficient way of slashing greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>Developing these transmission lines, however, is incredibly time-consuming and expensive. The TransWest project was first proposed in 2005, but the developers will be lucky to secure their final permits and begin moving dirt at the end of next year.</p><p>There’s no single agency in charge of overseeing or ushering along such projects, leaving companies to navigate a thicket of overlapping federal, state, county, and city jurisdictions—every one of which must sign off for a project to begin. As a result, few such transmission lines ever get built.</p><p><strong>A macro grid </strong></p><p>Direct current, in which electric charges constantly flow in a single direction, is an old technology. It and alternating current were the subject of one of the world’s first technology standards battles, pitting Thomas Edison against his former protégé Nikola Tesla in the “<a href=\"https://energy.gov/articles/war-currents-ac-vs-dc-power\">War of the Currents</a>” starting in the 1880s (see “<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/\">Edison’s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</a>”).</p><p>AC won this early war, mainly because, thanks to the development of transformers, its voltage could be cranked up for long-distance transmission and stepped down for homes and businesses.</p><p>But a series of technological improvements have substantially increased the functionality of DC, opening up new ways of designing and interconnecting the electricity grid.</p><p>Starting in the 1950s, some companies and countries began to deploy next-generation high-voltage DC transmission lines. These systems could carry more power much farther than AC lines, which suffer far more losses over greater distances. Crucially, direct-current lines can also be used to transmit power between “asynchronous” alternating-current systems like the nation’s three major regional grids, which otherwise can’t share power.</p><p>For the past two years, James McCalley, an engineering professor at Iowa State University, has been studying the best way to tie together those massive grid systems as part of the Department of Energy’s $220 million Grid Modernization Initiative.</p><p>One way to solve the problem is to expand existing “back-to-back” conversion stations to provide more east-to-west transmission capacity. These systems allow transmission between two grids, by converting the power to DC and then back to AC again at the point where they “cross the seam.”</p><p>Another approach adds three point-to-point transmission lines, running east to west, connecting the heart of each grid to that of the other. Yet another solution is a so-called “macro grid” of long DC transmission lines covering much of the country. It runs up the Florida panhandle, across the South, north to Seattle, east to Minneapolis, and back down to Louisiana, with several additional lines crisscrossing the West.</p><div><p><span>Related Story</span></p><a href=\"/s/609077/how-blockchain-could-give-us-a-smarter-energy-grid/\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=180&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=360&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=1024&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=2048&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=850&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=1700&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=550&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=1100&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=401&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=802&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"><img src=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=180&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552\" srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=180&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/mitblockchainsq.jpg?sw=360&cx=0&cy=672&cw=2760&ch=1552 2x\"/></source></source></source></source></source></picture></a><a href=\"/s/609077/how-blockchain-could-give-us-a-smarter-energy-grid/\">How Blockchain Could Give Us a Smarter Energy Grid</a><p>Energy experts believe that blockchain technology can solve a maze of red tape and data management problems.</p></div><p>McCalley and his team developed models to simulate each of these scenarios over a 15-year period. They found that all three demonstrated a strong economic payoff, providing a benefit of at least $2.50 in savings for every $1 invested in the transmission system.</p><p>With direct-current lines, grid operators have more options for energy sources throughout the day, allowing them to tap into, say, cheap wind two states away during times of peak demand instead of turning to nearby but more expensive natural-gas plants for a few hours.

A <a href=\"https://energy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanfordcleanenergyfinanceframingdoc10-31_final.pdf\">report</a> released by Stanford in October highlighted a number of possibilities, including granting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the same “siting authority” for transmission lines that it already has over natural-gas pipelines.</p><p>“Without clear, predictable siting authority, it’s going to be very difficult to build out an intelligent, comprehensive HVDC network,” says Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford, a coauthor of the report.</p><p>Another critical challenge for long-range transmission is that utilities have little incentive to pay for these lines, MISO’s Osborn adds. The rules would need to change to allow utilities to recoup their investments and encourage them to cooperate across regions, he says.</p><p>Without additional regulatory shifts and concentrated federal authority, we’re likely to see more of what we’ve been seeing: one-off projects where the economics may work to connect one particular energy source to one particular market. But we’re not likely to see an integrated network like the ones envisioned by MISO and others.</p><p>And without those or some grid storage breakthrough, renewables aren’t likely to ever reach their full potential. Plants will sometimes generate more wind or solar power than a single market can use, at which point the price drops—and the incentive to add more renewable generation shrinks.

It can already rapidly dump power between west-central Utah and southern California. With coal prices remaining high relative to natgas and California pushing for more renewables, the future of the Intermountain Power Plant is in question. It seems shortsighted then, to not plan an interconnection at Delta from the start.<p>Redundancy and resiliency is another issue. Most of the transmission lines between the Las Vegas Valley and Mesquite, NV closely parallel each other, the Union Pacific railroad, and I-15. One major disruption to a small area could easily cripple a significant portion of southern California&#x27;s power capacity (including power lines [3] to Glen Canyon Dam, Navajo Power Station, and the coal plans around Farmington, NM), and cut off a critical transportation route with the interior.

Deep work has allowed me crank on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanagram.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanagram.co</a> solo. I do one thing at a time. While I&#x27;m doing that task I&#x27;m basically disconnected from the world - No email, no messaging, no phone, nothing. I&#x27;ve got 2 kitchen timers on my desk: One set to 60min, the other 15min. I spend the whole day offline alternating between focused tasks for 60min and 15min breaks. I&#x27;m constantly surprised by how much I can accomplish with 40min still left on the timer. During the 15min breaks I stay offline. Using this approach of doing one thing at a time I find it&#x27;s relatively easy to flow from one thing to the next. Unless I crack and get pulled into a network tool :)<p>For longer, 2-3 day tasks, I completely log off and don&#x27;t connect to the world until it&#x27;s done. This means avoiding any network tool through the evenings and mornings until the stretch is over. Easier said than done. Some of my family and friends think I&#x27;m weird or get frustrated by my inaccessibility. But they get over it.<p>After a 2-3 day deep binge like the OP I also face challenges moving from one discipline (say programming) to another (a marketing video). One tool I use is yoga. For a while I had a daily meditation habit going but it&#x27;s been replaced with 2-3x &#x2F; week hot yoga. I find it has a way of cleansing my mind and energizing me for the next thing. I also go on fat bike rides to unlock the power nature&#x27;s constant stimuli has on your mind as Cal talks about in the book.","parent":16453327,"id":16454825,"by":"aacook"},{"type":"comment","time":1519496815,"text":"The acknowledgment that task switching is difficult when fully immersed in an existing focus that requires creative thinking has been an area of conflicting points of view in my current position as a developer, especially since I tend to play project manager and business analyst consistently in my projects. The tasks individually may not always seem that difficult from the surface, but they always seem to require the necessary attention to ensure they are resolved efficiently and effectively, which can be difficult when you’re trying to orchestrate everything while trying to make sure that one piece specifically is executed properly. I’ve been told that’s just how things go and there’s no getting around it so I’ve been forced to adopt my own strategies. My constant insistence that there are times that I will be working on one thing and nothing else unless the sky is falling has helped to a point, although the way this has often been executed results in me pulling an all-nighter so that I can focus without distractions. Reviewing my time sheets will show adjoining 16-19 hour days when I’m working on a large project just due to the fact that I’ve built up inertia and I know that may not last once a client issue comes up or a new project comes down the pipeline. It’s not all bad though and I somewhat seem to thrive to be honest.

Spending more time up-front breaking down a large task into smaller, more-manageable tasks might help. This is something that many engineers struggle with, but there are huge advantages to this kind of discipline that go beyond taming your concentration issues, so this could be valuable in more ways than one.<p>- As others have said, go for a walk. There&#x27;s something about activating our peripheral vision and looking from side to side that activates different parts of our brains and makes us more creative. It&#x27;s even used as a therapeutic technique (EMDR) for dealing with PTSD.<p>- Find non-project tasks that you can do to fill less productive gaps. Do code reviews, go back to old projects and fill-in additional test coverage, play with some new technology&#x2F;tool...a lot of teams neglect hygiene tasks anyways, so you may benefit from acknowledging your weaknesses and trying to make the best of it.<p>- Offer to pair with engineers for the rest of the day. If you know you can&#x27;t be productive for that time period on your own, perhaps you can add value as an extra set of eyes.<p>- Don&#x27;t fight it, embrace it. There&#x27;s a mantra in startups to embrace your limitations. As engineers, we&#x27;re not nearly as good at problem solving when we have no constraints. But when there&#x27;s some real-world concern that points us in a particular direction, it&#x27;s often easier to find the right solution. So look at this the same way. Don&#x27;t beat yourself up about it. Be kind to yourself and accept that it&#x27;s just a reality. Once you do that, put on your engineering hat and think of how best to deal with an unideal situation. Because situations are never ideal in the real world.<p>- Learn to meditate, particularly anapana meditation where you train yourself to concentrate on nothing but the breath. Concentration is a skill that can be practiced. It may be that you&#x27;re not able to concentrate on something new because you&#x27;re still concentrating on your previous task. Learning to clear your mind may help you move on to something new after a short break.<p>Best of luck!","parent":16453227,"id":16453926,"by":"curun1r"},{"type":"comment","time":1519494881,"text":"I think there&#x27;s something to be said that if you REALLY enjoy what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll immerse yourself into it with infinite willpower, and most importantly, you&#x27;ll be ridiculously happy doing it.

You do it for its own sake because it’s fun. Psychology says, though, that once you extrinsically motivate people to do something they used to intrinsically enjoy, their enjoyment of that activity goes down. This is just one possibility, though, and I don’t think it’s fair to jump to the conclusion that if you don’t find something as fun as a video game then clearly you shouldn’t be doing it.<p>I’ll conclude with this. A job is a job. Nobody asks the Kmart cashier if she’s passionate about ringing up items. Nobody asks the dentist if they’re a rockstar tooth ninja. Nobody asks the lawyer if they’re “on fire” for litigating.<p>OP, if you’re drained after work tasks, I understand; I get that way too.
